*  Cross-validation is briefly introduced in Section 5.2.4 and elaborated upon in Chapter 6. See if 
you can introduce a data example in Chapter 5 to give the reader a better flavor as to how to make this happen. 
*  Many "Actuarial Exam Questions." Replace many of them with data driven questions examples.
