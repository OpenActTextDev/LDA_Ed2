# Model Selection and Estimation {#ChapModelSelection}

*Chapter Preview*. Model selection and estimation are fundamental
aspects of statistical modeling. Chapters \@ref(ChapFrequency-Modeling)
and \@ref(ChapSeverity) have described how to fit parametric models to
frequency and severity data, respectively. This chapter begins with
nonparametric estimation. To compare alternative parametric models, it
is helpful to summarize data without reference to a specific parametric
distribution. Section \@ref(S:MS:NonParInf) describes nonparametric
estimation, and how it can be used to provide starting values for
parametric procedures.To provide a flavor as to how they can be adapted
to alternative sampling schemes, Section \@ref(S:MS:ModifiedData)
describes estimation for modified data including grouped, censored and
truncated data (following the Section \@ref(S:MaxLikeEstimation)
introduction). The process of model selection is then summarized in
Section \@ref(S:MS:ModelSelection), including tools for model
comparisons and diagnostics. Although our focus is on data from
continuous distributions, the same process can be used for discrete
versions or data that come from a hybrid combination of discrete and
continuous distributions.

## Nonparametric Estimation {#S:MS:NonParInf}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, you learn how to:

-   Estimate moments, quantiles, and distributions without reference to
    a parametric distribution
-   Summarize the data graphically without reference to a parametric
    distribution
-   Use nonparametric estimators to approximate parameters that can be
    used to start a parametric estimation procedure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Nonparametric Methods {#S:MS:NonParEst}

In Section \@ref(S:basic-frequency-distributions) for frequency and
Section \@ref(S:BasicQuantities) for severity, we learned how to
summarize a distribution by computing means, variances,
quantiles/percentiles, and so on. To approximate these summary measures
using a dataset, one strategy is to:

i.  assume a parametric form for a distribution, such as a negative
    binomial for frequency or a gamma distribution for severity,
ii. estimate the parameters of that distribution, and then
iii. use the distribution with the estimated parameters to calculate the
     desired summary measure.

This is the `r Gloss('parametric')` approach. Another strategy is to
estimate the desired summary measure directly from the observations
*without* reference to a parametric model. Not surprisingly, this is
known as the `r Gloss('nonparametric')` approach.

Let us start by considering the most basic type of
`r Gloss('sampling scheme')` and assume that observations are
realizations from a set of random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ that are
`r Gloss('iid')` draws from an unknown population distribution
$F(\cdot)$. An equivalent way of saying this is that $X_1, \ldots, X_n$,
is a *random sample* (with replacement) from $F(\cdot)$. To see how this
works, we now describe nonparametric estimators of many important
measures that summarize a distribution.

#### Moment Estimators {#S:MS:MomentEstimator}

We learned how to define moments in Section
\@ref(S:generating-functions) for frequency and Section
\@ref(S:Chap3Moments) for severity. In particular, the $k$-th moment,
$\mathrm{E~}[X^k] = \mu^{\prime}_k$, summarizes many aspects of the
distribution for different choices of $k$. Here, $\mu^{\prime}_k$ is
sometimes called the $k$th *population* moment to distinguish it from
the $k$th sample moment, $$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^k ,
$$ which is the corresponding nonparametric estimator. In typical
applications, $k$ is a positive integer, although it need not be in
theory.

An important special case is the first moment where $k=1$. In this case,
the prime symbol ($\prime$) and the $1$ subscript are usually dropped
and one uses $\mu=\mu^{\prime}_1$ to denote the population mean, or
simply the *mean*. The corresponding sample estimator for $\mu$ is
called the *sample mean*, denoted with a bar on top of the random
variable:

$$
\overline{X} =\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i .
$$

Another type of summary measure of interest is the $k$*-th central
moment*, $\mathrm{E~} [(X-\mu)^k] = \mu_k$. (Sometimes, $\mu^{\prime}_k$
is called the $k$-th *raw* moment to distinguish it from the central
moment $\mu_k$.). A nonparametric, or sample, estimator of $\mu_k$ is $$
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(X_i - \overline{X}\right)^k .
$$ The second central moment ($k=2$) is an important case for which we
typically assign a new symbol, $\sigma^2 = \mathrm{E~} [(X-\mu)^2]$,
known as the *variance*. Properties of the sample moment estimator of
the variance such as
$n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(X_i - \overline{X}\right)^2$ have been studied
extensively but is not the only possible estimator. The most widely used
version is one where the effective sample size is reduced by one, and so
we define $$
s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(X_i - \overline{X}\right)^2.
$$

Dividing by $n-1$ instead of $n$ matters little when you have a large
sample size $n$ as is common in insurance applications. The *sample
variance* estimator $s^2$ is `r Gloss('unbiased')` in the sense that
$\mathrm{E~} [s^2] = \sigma^2$, a desirable property particularly when
interpreting results of an analysis.

#### Empirical Distribution Function

We have seen how to compute nonparametric estimators of the $k$th moment
$\mathrm{E~} [X^k]$. In the same way, for any known function
$\mathrm{g}(\cdot)$, we can estimate $\mathrm{E~} [\mathrm{g}(X)]$ using
$n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{g}(X_i)$.

Now consider the function $\mathrm{g}(X) = I(X \le x)$ for a fixed $x$.
Here, the notation $I(\cdot)$ is the `r Gloss('indicator')` function; it
returns 1 if the event $(\cdot)$ is true and 0 otherwise. Note that now
the random variable $\mathrm{g}(X)$ has Bernoulli distribution (a
binomial distribution with $n=1$). We can use this distribution to
readily calculate quantities such as the mean and the variance. For
example, for this choice of $\mathrm{g}(\cdot)$, the expected value is
$\mathrm{E~} [I(X \le x)] = \Pr(X \le x) = F(x)$, the distribution
function evaluated at $x$. Using the `r Gloss('analog principle')`, we
define the nonparametric estimator of the distribution function

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_n(x)
&=  \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n I\left(X_i \le x\right) \\
&=  \frac{\text{number of observations less than or equal to }x}{n} . 
\end{aligned}
$$ As $F_n(\cdot)$ is based on only observations and does not assume a
parametric family for the distribution, it is nonparametric and also
known as the `r Gloss('empirical distribution function')`. It is also
known as the *empirical cumulative distribution function* and, in `R`,
one can use the `ecdf(.)` function to compute it.

**Example 5.1.1. Toy Dataset**. To illustrate, consider a fictitious, or
"toy," dataset of $n=10$ observations. Determine the empirical
distribution function.

$$
{\small
\begin{array}{c|cccccccccc}
\hline
i &1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10 \\
X_i& 10 &15 &15 &15 &20 &23 &23 &23 &23 &30\\
\hline
\end{array}
}
$$

`r HideExample('5.1.1', 'Show Example Solution')`

You should check that the sample mean is $\overline{X} = 19.7$ and that
the sample variance is $s^2 =34.45556$. The corresponding empirical
distribution function is

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_n(x) &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0 & \text{ for }\ x<10 \\
0.1 & \text{ for }\ 10 \leq x<15 \\
0.4 & \text{ for }\ 15 \leq x<20 \\
0.5 & \text{ for }\ 20 \leq x<23 \\
0.9 & \text{ for }\ 23 \leq x<30 \\
1 & \text{ for }\ x \geq 30,
\end{array}
\right.\end{aligned}
$$

as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:EDFToy). The empirical distribution is
generally discrete and continuous from the right.

#### Quartiles, Percentiles and Quantiles {#S:MS:QuantileEstimator}

We have already seen in Section \@ref(S:Chap3Moments) the
`r Gloss('median')`, which is the number such that approximately half of
a dataset is below (or above) it. The `r Gloss('first quartile')` is the
number such that approximately 25% of the data is below it and the
`r Gloss('third quartile')` is the number such that approximately 75% of
the data is below it. A $100p$ `r Gloss('percentile', '4.1')` is the
number such that $100 \times p$ percent of the data is below it.

To generalize this concept, consider a distribution function $F(\cdot)$,
which may or may not be continuous, and let $q$ be a fraction so that
$0<q<1$. We want to define a `r Gloss('quantile')`, say $q_F$, to be a
number such that $F(q_F) \approx q$. Notice that when $q = 0.5$, $q_F$
is the median; when $q = 0.25$, $q_F$ is the first quartile, and so on.
In the same way, when $q = 0, 0.01, 0.02, \ldots, 0.99, 1.00$, the
resulting $q_F$ is a percentile. So, a quantile generalizes the concepts
of median, quartiles, and percentiles.

To be precise, for a given $0<q<1$, define the $q$**th quantile** $q_F$
to be *any* number that satisfies

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
F(q_F-) \le q \le F(q_F)
(\#eq:Quantile)
\end{equation}
```
Here, the notation $F(x-)$ means to evaluate the function $F(\cdot)$ as
a left-hand limit.

To get a better understanding of this definition, let us look at a few
special cases. First, consider the case where $X$ is a continuous random
variable so that the distribution function $F(\cdot)$ has no jump
points, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:Quantile1). In this figure, a
few fractions, $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$ are shown with their
corresponding quantiles $q_{F,1}$, $q_{F,2}$, and $q_{F,3}$. In each
case, it can be seen that $F(q_F-)= F(q_F)$ so that there is a unique
quantile. Because we can find a unique inverse of the distribution
function at any $0<q<1$, we can write $q_F= F^{-1}(q)$.

(ref:Quantile1) **Continuous Quantile Case**

```{r Quantile1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Quantile1)', out.width='60%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
curve(pnorm(x,0,1), -4, 4, ylab="F(x)", xaxt="n", yaxt="n", lwd=2)
axis(side=2, at=c(0.1,0.5,0.9), labels=c(expression(q[1]),expression(q[2]),expression(q[3])),las=1)
axis(side=1, at=c(qnorm(0.1,0,1), qnorm(0.5,0,1), qnorm(0.9,0,1)), labels=c(expression(q['F,1']), expression(q['F,2']), expression(q['F,3'])))
segments(x0=-4, y0=0.1, x1=qnorm(0.1,0,1), y1=0.1, lty=1)
segments(x0=-4, y0=0.5, x1=qnorm(0.5,0,1), y1=0.5, lty=1)
segments(x0=-4, y0=0.9, x1=qnorm(0.9,0,1), y1=0.9, lty=1)
segments(x0=qnorm(0.1,0,1), y0=0, x1=qnorm(0.1,0,1), y1=0.1, lty=3)
segments(x0=qnorm(0.5,0,1), y0=0, x1=qnorm(0.5,0,1), y1=0.5, lty=3)
segments(x0=qnorm(0.9,0,1), y0=0, x1=qnorm(0.9,0,1), y1=0.9, lty=3)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:Quantile2) shows three cases for distribution
functions. The left panel corresponds to the continuous case just
discussed. The middle panel displays a jump point similar to those we
already saw in the empirical distribution function of Figure
\@ref(fig:EDFToy). For the value of $q$ shown in this panel, we still
have a unique value of the quantile $q_F$. Even though there are many
values of $q$ such that $F(q_F-) \le q \le F(q_F)$, for a particular
value of $q$, there is only one solution to equation \@ref(eq:Quantile).
The right panel depicts a situation in which the quantile cannot be
uniquely determined for the $q$ shown as there is a range of $q_F$'s
satisfying equation \@ref(eq:Quantile).

**Example 5.1.2. Toy Dataset: Continued.** Determine quantiles
corresponding to the 20th, 50th, and 95th percentiles.

`r HideExample('5.1.2', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution**. Consider Figure \@ref(fig:EDFToy). The case of $q=0.20$
corresponds to the middle panel of Figure Figure \@ref(fig:Quantile2),
so the 20th percentile is 15. The case of $q=0.50$ corresponds to the
right panel, so the median is any number between 20 and 23 inclusive.
Many software packages use the average 21.5 (e.g. `R`, as seen below).
For the 95th percentile, the solution is 30. We can see from Figure
\@ref(fig:EDFToy) that 30 also corresponds to the 99th and the 99.99th
percentiles.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

```

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

By taking a weighted average between data observations, smoothed
empirical quantiles can handle cases such as the right panel in Figure
\@ref(fig:Quantile2). The $q$th `r Gloss('smoothed empirical quantile')`
is defined as $$
\hat{\pi}_q = (1-h) X_{(j)} + h X_{(j+1)}
$$ where $j=\lfloor(n+1)q\rfloor$, $h=(n+1)q-j$, and
$X_{(1)}, \ldots, X_{(n)}$ are the ordered values (known as the *order
statistics*) corresponding to $X_1, \ldots, X_n$. (Recall that the
brackets $\lfloor \cdot\rfloor$ are the floor function denoting the
greatest integer value.) Note that $\hat{\pi}_q$ is simply a linear
interpolation between $X_{(j)}$ and $X_{(j+1)}$.

**Example 5.1.3. Toy Dataset: Continued.** Determine the 50th and 20th
smoothed percentiles.

`r HideExample('5.1.3', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution** Take $n=10$ and $q=0.5$. Then,
$j=\lfloor(11)(0.5) \rfloor= \lfloor 5.5 \rfloor=5$ and
$h=(11)(0.5)-5=0.5$. Then the 0.5-th smoothed empirical quantile is
$$\hat{\pi}_{0.5} = (1-0.5) X_{(5)} + (0.5) X_{(6)} = 0.5 (20) + (0.5)(23) = 21.5.$$
Now take $n=10$ and $q=0.2$. In this case,
$j=\lfloor(11)(0.2)\rfloor=\lfloor 2.2 \rfloor=2$ and
$h=(11)(0.2)-2=0.2$. Then the 0.2-th smoothed empirical quantile is
$$\hat{\pi}_{0.2} = (1-0.2) X_{(2)} + (0.2) X_{(3)} = 0.8 (15) + (0.2)(15) = 15.$$

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Density Estimators {#S:MS:Density}

**Discrete Variable.** When the random variable is discrete, estimating
the probability mass function $f(x) = \Pr(X=x)$ is straightforward. We
simply use the sample average, defined to be

$$
f_n(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n I(X_i = x),
$$

which is the proportion of the sample equal to $x$.

**Continuous Variable within a Group.** For a continuous random
variable, consider a discretized formulation in which the domain of
$F(\cdot)$ is partitioned by constants $\{c_0 < c_1 < \cdots < c_k\}$
into intervals of the form $[c_{j-1}, c_j)$, for $j=1, \ldots, k$. The
data observations are thus "grouped" by the intervals into which they
fall. Then, we might use the basic definition of the empirical mass
function, or a variation such as
$$f_n(x) = \frac{n_j}{n \times (c_j - c_{j-1})}  \ \ \ \ \ \ c_{j-1} \le x < c_j,$$
where $n_j$ is the number of observations ($X_i$) that fall into the
interval $[c_{j-1}, c_j)$.

**Continuous Variable (not grouped).** Extending this notion to
instances where we observe individual data, note that we can always
create arbitrary groupings and use this formula. More formally, let
$b>0$ be a small positive constant, known as a `r Gloss('bandwidth')`,
and define a density estimator to be

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
f_n(x) = \frac{1}{2nb} \sum_{i=1}^n I(x-b < X_i \le x + b)
(\#eq:KDF)
\end{equation}
```
`r HideProofTheory('kernel.1',"Show A Snippet of Theory")`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Snippet of Theory.** The idea is that the estimator $f_n(x)$ in
equation \@ref(eq:KDF) is the average over $n$ *iid* realizations of a
random variable with mean

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{E~ } \left[\frac{1}{2b} I(x-b < X \le x + b)\right] &=  \frac{1}{2b}\left(F(x+b)-F(x-b)\right) \\
& \rightarrow  F^{\prime}(x) = f(x),
\end{aligned}
$$

as $b\rightarrow 0$. That is, $f_n(x)$ is an
`r Gloss('asymptotically unbiased')` estimator of $f(x)$ (its
expectation approaches the true value as sample size increases to
infinity). This development assumes some smoothness of $F(\cdot)$, in
particular, twice differentiability at $x$, but makes no assumptions on
the form of the distribution function $F$. Because of this, the density
estimator $f_n$ is said to be *nonparametric*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

</div>

More generally, define the `r Gloss('kernel density estimator')` of the
`r Gloss('pdf')` at $x$ as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation} 
f_n(x) = \frac{1}{nb} \sum_{i=1}^n w\left(\frac{x-X_i}{b}\right) ,
(\#eq:kernelDens)
\end{equation}
```
where $w$ is a probability density function centered about 0. Note that
equation \@ref(eq:KDF) is a special case of the kernel density estimator
where $w(x) = \frac{1}{2}I(-1 < x \le 1)$, also known as the *uniform
kernel*. Other popular choices are shown in [Table 5.1](#tab:5.1).

<a id=tab:5.1></a>

Table 5.1. **Popular Kernel Choices**

$$
{\small
\begin{matrix}
\begin{array}{l|cc}
\hline
\text{Kernel} &  w(x) \\
\hline
\text{Uniform } &  \frac{1}{2}I(-1 < x \le 1) \\
\text{Triangle} &  (1-|x|)\times I(|x| \le 1) \\
\text{Epanechnikov} & \frac{3}{4}(1-x^2) \times I(|x| \le 1) \\
\text{Gaussian} & \phi(x) \\
\hline
\end{array}\end{matrix}
}
$$

Here, $\phi(\cdot)$ is the standard normal density function. As we will
see in the following example, the choice of bandwidth $b$ comes with a
`r Gloss('bias-variance tradeoff')` between matching local
distributional features and reducing the volatility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.1.4. Property Fund.** Figure \@ref(fig:Density2) shows a
histogram (with shaded gray rectangles) of logarithmic property claims
from 2010. The (blue) thick curve represents a Gaussian kernel density
where the bandwidth was selected automatically using an ad hoc rule
based on the sample size and volatility of these data. For this dataset,
the bandwidth turned out to be $b=0.3255$. For comparison, the (red)
dashed curve represents the density estimator with a bandwidth equal to
0.1 and the green smooth curve uses a bandwidth of 1. As anticipated,
the smaller bandwidth (0.1) indicates taking local averages over less
data so that we get a better idea of the local average, but at the price
of higher volatility. In contrast, the larger bandwidth (1) smooths out
local fluctuations, yielding a smoother curve that may miss
perturbations in the local average. For actuarial applications, we
mainly use the kernel density estimator to get a quick visual impression
of the data. From this perspective, you can simply use the default ad
hoc rule for bandwidth selection, knowing that you have the ability to
change it depending on the situation at hand.

Nonparametric density estimators, such as the kernel estimator, are
regularly used in practice. The concept can also be extended to give
smooth versions of an empirical distribution function. Given the
definition of the kernel density estimator, the *kernel estimator of the
distribution function* can be found as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{F}_n(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n W\left(\frac{x-X_i}{b}\right).\end{aligned}
$$

where $W$ is the distribution function associated with the kernel
density $w$. To illustrate, for the uniform kernel, we have
$w(y) = \frac{1}{2}I(-1 < y \le 1)$, so

$$
\begin{aligned}
W(y) =
\begin{cases}
0 &            y<-1\\
\frac{y+1}{2}& -1 \le y < 1 \\
1 & y \ge 1 \\
\end{cases}\end{aligned} .
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.1.5. Actuarial Exam Question.**

You study five lives to estimate the time from the onset of a disease to
death. The times to death are:

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
2 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 7  \\
\end{array}
$$

Using a triangular kernel with bandwidth $2$, calculate the density
function estimate at 2.5.

`r HideExample('5.1.5', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** For the kernel density estimate, we have
$$f_n(x) = \frac{1}{nb} \sum_{i=1}^n w\left(\frac{x-X_i}{b}\right),$$
where $n=5$, $b=2$, and $x=2.5$. For the triangular kernel,
$w(x) = (1-|x|)\times I(|x| \le 1)$. Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c}
\hline
X_i & \frac{x-X_i}{b} & w\left(\frac{x-X_i}{b} \right) \\
\hline
2 & \frac{2.5-2}{2}=\frac{1}{4} &  (1-\frac{1}{4})(1) = \frac{3}{4} \\
\hline
3 & & \\
3 & \frac{2.5-3}{2}=\frac{-1}{4} & \left(1-\left| \frac{-1}{4} \right| \right)(1) = \frac{3}{4} \\
3 & & \\
\hline
7 & \frac{2.5-7}{2}=-2.25 & (1-|-2.25|)(0) = 0\\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Then the kernel density estimate at $x=2.5$ is
$$f_n(2.5) = \frac{1}{5(2)}\left( \frac{3}{4} + (3) \frac{3}{4} + 0 \right) = \frac{3}{10}$$

#### Plug-in Principle {#S:MS:PlugIn}

One way to create a nonparametric estimator of some quantity is to use
the *analog* or `r Gloss('plug-in principle')` where one replaces the
unknown `r Gloss('cdf')` $F$ with a known estimate such as the empirical
*cdf* $F_n$. So, if we are trying to estimate
$\mathrm{E}~[\mathrm{g}(X)]=\mathrm{E}_F~[\mathrm{g}(X)]$ for a generic
function *g*, then we define a nonparametric estimator to be
$\mathrm{E}_{F_n}~[\mathrm{g}(X)]=n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{g}(X_i)$.

To see how this works, as a special case of *g* we consider the loss per
payment random variable is $Y = (X-d)_+$ and the *loss elimination ratio
(LER)* introduced in Section \@ref(S:PolicyDeduct). We can express this
as $$
LER(d) = \frac{\mathrm{E~}[X - (X-d)_+]}{\mathrm{E~}[X]} =\frac{\mathrm{E~}[\min(X,d)]}{\mathrm{E~}[X]} ,
$$ for a fixed deductible $d$.

**Example 5.1.6. Bodily Injury Claims and Loss Elimination Ratios**

```{r comment="", warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Example from Derrig et al
#  "Applications of resampling methods in actuarial practice"
#  CAS Proceedings 2001
BIData <- read.csv("Data/DerrigResampling.csv", header =T)
BIData$Censored <- 1*(BIData$AmountPaid >= BIData$PolicyLimit)
BIDataUncensored <- subset(BIData, Censored == 0) 
X <- BIDataUncensored$AmountPaid
```

We use a sample of `r nrow(BIData)` closed auto claims from Boston from
@derrig2001applications. Losses are recorded for payments due to bodily
injuries in auto accidents. Losses are not subject to deductibles but
are limited by various maximum coverage amounts that are also available
in the data. It turns out that only `r sum(BIData$Censored)` out of
`r nrow(BIData)` ($\approx$
`r round(100*sum(BIData$Censored)/nrow(BIData), digits=0)`%) were
subject to these policy limits and so we ignore these data for this
illustration.

The average loss paid is `r round(mean(X),digits=0)` in U.S. dollars.
Figure \@ref(fig:BIClaims) shows other aspects of the distribution.
Specifically, the left-hand panel shows the empirical distribution
function, the right-hand panel gives a nonparametric density plot.

(ref:BIClaims) **Bodily Injury Claims. The left-hand panel gives the empirical distribution function. The right-hand panel presents a nonparametric density plot.**

```{r BIClaims, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:BIClaims)', fig.align='center'}
BI.cdf <- ecdf(X)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(BI.cdf , main="",xlab="x", ylab = "ECDF", cex = 0.3)
plot(density(X), main="", xlab="x")

```

The impact of bodily injury losses can be mitigated by the imposition of
limits or purchasing reinsurance policies (see Section 10.3). To
quantify the impact of these risk mitigation tools, it is common to
compute the *loss elimination ratio (LER)* as introduced in Section
\@ref(S:PolicyDeduct). The distribution function is not available and so
must be estimated in some way. Using the plug-in principle, a
nonparametric estimator can be defined as

$$
LER_n(d) = \frac{n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \min(X_i,d)}{n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \min(X_i,d)}{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i} .
$$

```{r comment="", echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
LER <- function(d){
  sumClaims <- sum(X)
  sumClaims_d <- sum(pmin(X,d))
  LER <-   sumClaims_d/sumClaims
  return(LER)  
}
dVec <- seq(0,max(X), length.out = 1000)
LERVec <- 0 * dVec
for (i in 1:length(dVec)){LERVec[i] <- LER(dVec[i])} 
```

Figure \@ref(fig:LER) shows the estimator $LER_n(d)$ for various choices
of $d$. For example, at $d=1,000$, we have $LER_n(1000) \approx$
`r round(LER(1000),digits = 4)`. Thus, imposing a limit of 1,000 means
that expected retained claims are `r round(100*LER(1000),digits = 2)`
percent lower when compared to expected claims with a zero deductible.

(ref:LER) **LER for Bodily Injury Claims. The figure presents the loss elimination ratio (LER) as a function of deductible $d$.**

```{r LER, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:LER)',  fig.align='center'}
plot(dVec,LERVec, xlab="d", ylab = "LER", cex=.3)
```

### Starting Values

The method of moments and percentile matching are nonparametric
estimation methods that provide alternatives to maximum likelihood.
Generally, maximum likelihood is the preferred technique because it
employs data more efficiently. (See Appendix Chapter \@ref(CAppC) for
precise definitions of efficiency.) However, methods of moments and
percentile matching are useful because they are easier to interpret and
therefore allow the actuary or analyst to explain procedures to others.
Additionally, the numerical estimation procedure (e.g. if performed in
`R`) for the maximum likelihood is iterative and requires starting
values to begin the recursive process. Although many problems are robust
to the choice of the starting values, for some complex situations, it
can be important to have a starting value that is close to the (unknown)
optimal value. Method of moments and percentile matching are techniques
that can produce desirable estimates without a serious computational
investment and can thus be used as a *starting value* for computing
maximum likelihood.

#### Method of Moments

Under the `r Gloss('method of moments')`, we approximate the moments of
the parametric distribution using the empirical (nonparametric) moments
described in Section \@ref(S:MS:MomentEstimator). We can then
algebraically solve for the parameter estimates.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.1.7. Property Fund.** For the 2010 property fund, there are
$n=1,377$ individual claims (in thousands of dollars) with

$$m_1 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i = 26.62259 \ \ \ \
\text{and} \ \ \ \
 m_2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 = 136154.6 .$$ Fit the parameters
of the gamma and Pareto distributions using the method of moments.

`r HideExample('5.1.7', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** To fit a gamma distribution, we have
$\mu_1 = \alpha \theta$ and
$\mu_2^{\prime} = \alpha(\alpha+1) \theta^2$. Equating the two yields
the method of moments estimators, easy algebra shows that

$$\alpha = \frac{\mu_1^2}{\mu_2^{\prime}-\mu_1^2}  \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \  \theta = \frac{\mu_2^{\prime}-\mu_1^2}{\mu_1}.$$

Thus, the method of moment estimators are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\alpha} &=  \frac{26.62259^2}{136154.6-26.62259^2} = 0.005232809 \\
\hat{\theta} &=  \frac{136154.6-26.62259^2}{26.62259} = 5,087.629.
\end{aligned}
$$

For comparison, the maximum likelihood values turn out to be
$\hat{\alpha}_{MLE} = 0.2905959$ and $\hat{\theta}_{MLE} = 91.61378$, so
there are big discrepancies between the two estimation procedures. This
is one indication, as we have seen before, that the gamma model fits
poorly.

In contrast, now assume a Pareto distribution so that
$\mu_1 = \theta/(\alpha -1)$ and
$\mu_2^{\prime} = 2\theta^2/((\alpha-1)(\alpha-2) )$. Note that this
expression for $\mu_2^{\prime}$ is only valid for $\alpha>2$. Easy
algebra shows

$$\alpha = 1+ \frac{\mu_2^{\prime}}{\mu_2^{\prime}-\mu_1^2} \ \ \ \
\text{and} \ \ \ \ \
 \theta = (\alpha-1)\mu_1.$$

Thus, the method of moment estimators are

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\alpha} &=  1+ \frac{136154.6}{136154.6-26,62259^2} = 2.005233 \\
\hat{\theta} &=  (2.005233-1) \cdot 26.62259 = 26.7619
\end{aligned}
$$

The maximum likelihood values turn out to be
$\hat{\alpha}_{MLE} = 0.9990936$ and $\hat{\theta}_{MLE} = 2.2821147$.
It is interesting that $\hat{\alpha}_{MLE}<1$; for the Pareto
distribution, recall that $\alpha <1$ means that the mean is infinite.
This is another indication that the property claims dataset is a long
tail distribution.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As the above example suggests, there is flexibility with the method of
moments. For example, we could have matched the second and third moments
instead of the first and second, yielding different estimators.
Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a solution will exist for each
problem. For data that are censored or truncated, matching moments is
possible for a few problems but, in general, this is a more difficult
scenario. Finally, for distributions where the moments do not exist or
are infinite, method of moments is not available. As an alternative, one
can use the percentile matching technique.

#### Percentile Matching

Under `r Gloss('percentile matching')`, we approximate the quantiles or
percentiles of the parametric distribution using the empirical
(nonparametric) quantiles or percentiles described in Section
\@ref(S:MS:QuantileEstimator).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.1.8. Property Fund.** For the 2010 property fund, we
illustrate matching on quantiles. In particular, the Pareto distribution
is intuitively pleasing because of the closed-form solution for the
quantiles. Recall that the distribution function for the Pareto
distribution is
$$F(x) = 1 - \left(\frac{\theta}{x+\theta}\right)^{\alpha}.$$ Easy
algebra shows that we can express the quantile as

$$F^{-1}(q) = \theta \left( (1-q)^{-1/\alpha} -1 \right).$$ for a
fraction $q$, $0<q<1$.

Determine estimates of the Pareto distribution parameters using the 25th
and 95th empirical quantiles.

`r HideExample('5.1.8', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.**

The 25th percentile (the first quartile) turns out to be $0.78853$ and
the 95th percentile is $50.98293$ (both in thousands of dollars). With
two equations
$$0.78853 = \theta \left( 1- (1-.25)^{-1/\alpha} \right) \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \ 50.98293 = \theta \left( 1- (1-.75)^{-1/\alpha} \right)$$
and two unknowns, the solution is
$$\hat{\alpha} = 0.9412076 \ \ \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \
\hat{\theta} = 2.205617 .$$ We remark here that a numerical routine is
required for these solutions as no analytic solution is available.
Furthermore, recall that the `r Gloss('maximum likelihood estimates')`
are $\hat{\alpha}_{MLE} = 0.9990936$ and
$\hat{\theta}_{MLE} = 2.2821147$, so the percentile matching provides a
better approximation for the Pareto distribution than the method of
moments.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.1.9. Actuarial Exam Question.** You are given:

(i) Losses follow a loglogistic distribution with cumulative
    distribution function:
    $$F(x) = \frac{\left(x/\theta\right)^{\gamma}}{1+\left(x/\theta\right)^{\gamma}}$$
(ii) The sample of losses is:

$$
\begin{array}{ccccccccccc}
10 &35 &80 &86 &90 &120 &158 &180 &200 &210 &1500 \\
\end{array}
$$

Calculate the estimate of $\theta$ by percentile matching, using the
40th and 80th empirically smoothed percentile estimates.

`r HideExample('5.1.9', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** With 11 observations, we have
$j=\lfloor(n+1)q\rfloor = \lfloor 12(0.4) \rfloor = \lfloor 4.8\rfloor=4$
and $h=(n+1)q-j = 12(0.4)-4=0.8$. By interpolation, the 40th empirically
smoothed percentile estimate is
$\hat{\pi}_{0.4} = (1-h) X_{(j)} + h X_{(j+1)} = 0.2(86)+0.8(90)=89.2$.

Similarly, for the 80th empirically smoothed percentile estimate, we
have $12(0.8)=9.6$ so the estimate is
$\hat{\pi}_{0.8} = 0.4(200)+0.6(210)=206$.

Using the loglogistic cumulative distribution, we need to solve the
following two equations for parameters ${\hat{\theta}}$ and
${\hat{\gamma}}$: $$
0.4=\frac{(89.2/{\hat{\theta}})^{\hat{\gamma}}}{1+(89.2/{\hat{\theta}})^{\hat{\gamma}}} \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ \   0.8=\frac{(206/{\hat{\theta}})^{\hat{\gamma}}}{1+(206/{\hat{\theta}})^{\hat{\gamma}}} .
$$

Solving for each parenthetical expression gives
$\frac{2}{3}=(89.2/\theta)^{\hat{\gamma}}$ and
$4=(206/{\hat{\theta}})^{\hat{\gamma}}$. Taking the ratio of the second
equation to the first gives
$6=(206/89.2)^{\hat{\gamma}}\Rightarrow {\hat{\gamma}}=\frac{\log(6)}{\log(206/89.2)} = 2.1407$.
Then $4^{1/2.1407}=206/{\hat{\theta}} \Rightarrow {\hat{\theta}}=107.8$.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like the method of moments, percentile matching is almost too flexible
in the sense that estimators can vary depending on different percentiles
chosen. For example, one actuary may use estimation on the 25th and 95th
percentiles whereas another uses the 20th and 80th percentiles. In
general estimated parameters will differ and there is no compelling
reason to prefer one over the other. Also as with the method of moments,
percentile matching is appealing because it provides a technique that
can be readily applied in selected situations and has an intuitive
basis. Although most actuarial applications use maximum likelihood
estimators, it can be convenient to have alternative approaches such as
method of moments and percentile matching available.

## Estimation using Modified Data {#S:MS:ModifiedData}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, you learn how to:

-   Describe grouped, censored, and truncated data
-   Estimate parametric distributions based on grouped, censored, and
    truncated data
-   Estimate distributions nonparametrically based on grouped, censored,
    and truncated data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Parametric Estimation using Modified Data {#S:MS:ModifiedData1}

Basic theory and many applications are based on *individual*
observations that are "*complete*" and "*unmodified*", as we have seen
in the previous section. Section \@ref(S:MaxLikeEstimation) introduced
the concept of observations that are "*modified*" due to two common
types of limitations: **censoring** and **truncation**. For example, it
is common to think about an insurance deductible as producing data that
are truncated (from the left) or policy limits as yielding data that are
censored (from the right). This viewpoint is from the primary insurer
(the seller of the insurance). Another viewpoint is that of a reinsurer
(an insurer of an insurance company) that will be discussed more in
Chapter \@ref(ChapPortMgt). A reinsurer may not observe a claim smaller
than an amount, only that a claim exists; this is an example of
censoring from the left. So, in this section, we cover the full gamut of
alternatives. Following the parametric methods introduced in Appendix
Chapters \@ref(CAppA) and \@ref(CAppC) for unmodified data, this section
will address parametric estimation methods for three alternatives to
individual, complete, and unmodified data: **interval-censored** data
available only in groups, data that are limited or **censored**, and
data that may not be observed due to **truncation**.

#### Grouped Data {#S:MS:GroupedData}

Consider a sample of size $n$ observed from the distribution $F(\cdot)$,
but in groups so that we only know the group into which each observation
fell, not the exact value. This is referred to as **grouped** or
**interval-censored** data. For example, we may be looking at two
successive years of annual employee records. People employed in the
first year but not the second have left sometime during the year. With
an exact departure date (individual data), we could compute the amount
of time that they were with the firm, which constitutes the type of
unmodified data required for the maximum likelihood procedure given in
Appendix Chapter \@ref(CAppC). Without the departure date (for grouped
data), we only know that they departed sometime during a year-long
interval, for which we may modify the maximum likelihood produre to
accommodate the change in data format.

Formalizing this idea, suppose there are $k$ groups or intervals
delimited by boundaries $c_0 < c_1< \cdots < c_k$. For each observation,
we only observe the interval into which it fell (e.g. $(c_{j-1}, c_j)$),
not the exact value. Thus, we only know the number of observations in
each interval. The constants $\{c_0 < c_1 < \cdots < c_k\}$ form some
partition of the domain of $F(\cdot)$. Then the probability of an
observation $X_i$ falling in the $j$th interval is $$\Pr\left(X
_i \in (c_{j-1}, c_j]\right) = F(c_j) - F(c_{j-1}).$$

The corresponding probability mass function for an observation is

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &=
\begin{cases}
F(c_1) - F(c_{0}) &   \text{if }\ x \in (c_{0}, c_1]\\
\vdots & \vdots \\
F(c_k) - F(c_{k-1}) &   \text{if }\ x \in (c_{k-1}, c_k]\\
\end{cases} \\
&= \prod_{j=1}^k \left\{F(c_j) - F(c_{j-1})\right\}^{I(x \in (c_{j-1}, c_j])}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Now, define $n_j$ to be the number of observations that fall in the
$j$th interval, $(c_{j-1}, c_j]$. According to the defintion from
Appendix Section \@ref(S:AppC:LF), the `r Gloss('likelihood function')`
(with respect to the parameter(s) $\theta$) is

$$
\begin{aligned}
L(\theta) = \prod_{j=1}^n f(x_i) = \prod_{j=1}^k \left\{F(c_j) - F(c_{j-1})\right\}^{n_j}.
\end{aligned}
$$

And the log-likelihood function is $$
\begin{aligned}
l(\theta) = \log L(\theta) = \log \prod_{j=1}^n f(x_i) = \sum_{j=1}^k n_j \log \left\{F(c_j) - F(c_{j-1})\right\}.
\end{aligned}
$$

Maximizing the likelihood function (or equivalently, maximizing the
log-likelihood function following the procedure in from Appendix Section
\@ref(S:AppC:MLE)) would then produce the maximum likelihood estimators
(MLEs) of parameters for grouped data. Properties of MLEs and the
resulting statistical inference procedures are given in Appendix Chapter
\@ref(CAppC).

**Example 5.2.1. Actuarial Exam Question.** You are given:

(i) Losses follow an exponential distribution with mean $\theta$.
(ii) A random sample of 20 losses is distributed as follows:

$$
{\small
\begin{array}{l|c}
\hline
\text{Loss Range} & \text{Frequency} \\
\hline
[0,1000] & 7 \\
(1000,2000] & 6 \\
(2000,\infty) & 7 \\
\hline
\end{array}
}
$$

Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$.

`r HideExample('5.2.1', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** $$
\begin{aligned}
L(\theta) &= F(1000)^7[F(2000)-F(1000)]^6[1-F(2000)]^7 \\
&= (1-e^{-1000/\theta})^7(e^{-1000/\theta} - e^{-2000/\theta})^6(e^{-2000/\theta})^7 \\
&= (1-p)^7(p-p^2)^6(p^2)^7 \\
&= p^{20}(1-p)^{13}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $p=e^{-1000/\theta}$. Maximizing this expression with respect to
$p$ is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood with respect to $\theta$.
The maximum occurs at $p=\frac{20}{33}$ and so
$\hat{\theta}=\frac{-1000}{\log(20/33)}= 1996.90$.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Censored Data

**Censoring** occurs when we record only a limited value of an
observation. The most common form is **right-censoring**, in which we
record the *smaller* of the "true" dependent variable and a censoring
value. Using notation, let $X$ represent an outcome of interest, such as
the loss due to an insured event or time until an event. Let $C_U$
denote the censoring value. With right-censored observations, we record
$X_U^{\ast}= \min(X, C_U) = X \wedge C_U$. We also record whether or not
censoring has occurred. Let $\delta_U= I(X \le C_U)$ be a binary
variable that is 0 if censoring occurs and 1 if it does not, that is,
$\delta_U$ indicates whether or not $X$ is uncensored.

For an example that we saw in Section \@ref(S:PolicyLimits), $C_U$ may
represent the upper limit of coverage of an insurance policy (we used
$u$ for the upper limit in that section). The loss may exceed the amount
$C_U$, but the insurer only has $C_U$ in its records as the amount paid
out and does not have the amount of the actual loss $X$ in its records.

Similarly, with **left-censoring**, we record the *larger* of a variable
of interest and a censoring variable. If $C_L$ is used to represent the
censoring value, we record $X_L^{\ast}= \max(X, C_L)$ along with the
censoring indicator $\delta_L= I(X > C_L)$.

As an example, you got a brief introduction to reinsurance (insurance
for insurers) in Section \@ref(S:Chap3Reinsurance) and will see more in
Chapter \@ref(ChapPortMgt). Suppose a reinsurer will cover insurer
losses greater than $C_L$; this means that the reinsurer is responsible
for the excess of $X_L^{\ast}$ over $C_L$. Using notation, the loss of
the reinsurer is $Y = X_L^{\ast} - C_L$. To see this, first consider the
case where the policyholder loss $X \le C_L$. Then, the insurer will pay
the entire claim and $Y =C_L- C_L=0$, no loss for the reinsurer. For
contrast, if the loss $X > C_L$, then $Y = X-C_L$ represents the
reinsurer's retained claims. Put another way, if a loss occurs, the
reinsurer records the actual amount if it exceeds the limit $C_L$ and
otherwise it only records that it had a loss of $0$.

#### Truncated Data

Censored observations are recorded for study, although in a limited
form. In contrast, **truncated** outcomes are a type of missing data. An
outcome is potentially truncated when the availability of an observation
depends on the outcome.

In insurance, it is common for observations to be **left-truncated** at
$C_L$ when the amount is $$
\begin{aligned}
Y &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\text{we do not observe }X & X \le C_L \\
X & X > C_L
\end{array}
\right.\end{aligned} .
$$

In other words, if $X$ is less than the threshold $C_L$, then it is not
observed.

For an example we saw in Section \@ref(S:PolicyDeduct), $C_L$ may
represent the deductible of an insurance policy (we used $d$ for the
deductible in that section). If the insured loss is less than the
deductible, then the insurer may not observe or record the loss at all.
If the loss exceeds the deductible, then the excess $X-C_L$ is the claim
that the insurer covers. In Section \@ref(S:PolicyDeduct), we defined
the per payment loss to be $$
Y^{P} = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\text{Undefined} & X \le d \\
X - d & X > d 
\end{matrix} \right. ,
$$ so that if a loss exceeds a deductible, we record the excess amount
$X-d$. This is very important when considering amounts that the insurer
will pay. However, for estimation purposes of this section, it matters
little if we subtract a known constant such as $C_L=d$. So, for our
truncated variable $Y$, we use the simpler convention and do not
subtract $d$.

Similarly for **right-truncated** data, if $X$ exceeds a threshold
$C_U$, then it is not observed. In this case, the amount is $$
\begin{aligned}
Y &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
X & X \le C_U \\
\text{we do not observe }X & X > C_U.
\end{array}
\right.\end{aligned}
$$

Classic examples of truncation from the right include $X$ as a measure
of distance to a star. When the distance exceeds a certain level $C_U$,
the star is no longer observable.

Figure \@ref(fig:CensorTrunc) compares truncated and censored
observations. Values of $X$ that are greater than the "upper" censoring
limit $C_U$ are not observed at all (right-censored), while values of
$X$ that are smaller than the "lower" truncation limit $C_L$ are
observed, but observed as $C_L$ rather than the actual value of $X$
(left-truncated).

-   **Type A - Right-censored.** This subject is alive at the beginning
    and the end of the study. Because the time of death is not known by
    the end of the study, it is right-censored. Most subjects are Type
    A.  
-   **Type B - Complete** information is available for a type B subject.
    The subject is alive at the beginning of the study and the death
    occurs within the observation period.
-   **Type C - Right-censored and left-truncated.** A type C subject is
    right-censored, in that death occurs after the observation period.
    However, the subject entered after the start of the study and is
    said to have a *delayed entry time*. Because the subject would not
    have been observed had death occurred before entry, it is
    left-truncated.
-   **Type D - Left-truncated.** A type D subject also has delayed
    entry. Because death occurs within the observation period, this
    subject is not right censored.
-   **Type E - Left-truncated.** A type E subject is not included in the
    study because death occurs prior to the observation period.
-   **Type F - Right-truncated.** Similarly, a type F subject is not
    included because the entry time occurs after the observation period.

#### Parametric Estimation using Censored and Truncated Data

Similar to grouped or interval-censored data, we may modify the maximum
likelihood procedure from Appendix Chapter \@ref(CAppC) for parametric
estimation using censored and/or truncated data.

For simplicity, we assume non-random censoring values and a continuous
outcome $X$. To begin, consider the case of right-censored data where we
record $X_U^{\ast}= \min(X, C_U)$ and censoring indicator
$\delta= I(X \le C_U)$. If censoring occurs so that $\delta=0$, then
$X > C_U$ and the likelihood associated with the observation is
$\Pr(X > C_U) = 1-F(C_U)$. If censoring does not occur so that
$\delta=1$, then $X \le C_U$ and the likelihood is $f(x)$. Summarizing,
we have the likelihood of a single observation as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1-F(C_U) & \text{if }\delta=0 \\
f(x) & \text{if } \delta = 1 
\end{array}
\right. = \left\{ f(x)\right\}^{\delta} \left\{1-F(C_U)\right\}^{1-\delta} .
\end{aligned}
$$

The right-hand expression allows us to present the likelihood more
compactly. Now, for an *iid* sample of size $n$, the likelihood is

$$
L(\theta) = 
\prod_{i=1}^n \left\{ f(x_i)\right\}^{\delta_i} \left\{1-F(C_{Ui})\right\}^{1-\delta_i} = \prod_{\delta_i=1} f(x_i) \prod_{\delta_i=0} \{1-F(C_{Ui})\},
$$

with potential censoring times $\{ C_{U1}, \ldots,C_{Un} \}$. Here, the
notation "$\prod_{\delta_i=1}$" means to take the product over
uncensored observations, and similarly for "$\prod_{\delta_i=0}$."

On the other hand, truncated data are handled in maximum likelihood
inference via conditional probabilities. Specifically, we adjust the
likelihood contribution by dividing by the probability that the variable
was observed. To summarize, we have the following contributions to the
likelihood function for six types of outcomes:

$$
{\small
\begin{array}{lc}
\hline
\text{Outcome} & \text{Likelihood Contribution} \\
\hline
\text{exact value} & f(x) \\
\text{right-censoring} & 1-F(C_U) \\
\text{left-censoring} & F(C_L) \\
\text{right-truncation} & f(x)/F(C_U) \\
\text{left-truncation} & f(x)/(1-F(C_L)) \\
\text{interval-censoring} & F(C_U)-F(C_L) \\
\hline
\end{array}
}
$$

For known outcomes and censored data, the likelihood is
$$L(\theta) = \prod_{E} f(x_i) \prod_{R} \{1-F(C_{Ui})\} \prod_{L}
F(C_{Li}) \prod_{I} (F(C_{Ui})-F(C_{Li})),$$ where "$\prod_{E}$" is the
product over observations with *E*xact values, and similarly for
$R$ight-, $L$eft- <br> and $I$nterval-censoring.

For right-censored and left-truncated data, the likelihood is
$$L(\theta) = \prod_{E} \frac{f(x_i)}{1-F(C_{Li})} \prod_{R} \frac{1-F(C_{Ui})}{1-F(C_{Li})},$$
and similarly for other combinations.

With the forms of likelihood functions derived above, we may perform
maximum likelihood estimation and inference based on the distribution
functions and maximum likelihood procedures given respectively in
Appendix Chapters \@ref(CAppD) and \@ref(CAppC). To get further
insights, consider the following examples.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

`r HideExample('Exp.4f', 'Show Special Case - Exponential Distribution')`

**Special Case: Exponential Distribution.** Consider data that are
right-censored and left-truncated, with random variables $X_i$ that are
exponentially distributed with mean $\theta$. With these specifications,
recall that $f(x) = \theta^{-1} \exp(-x/\theta)$ and
$F(x) = 1-\exp(-x/\theta)$.

For this special case, the log-likelihood is

$$
\begin{aligned}
l(\theta) &= \sum_{E} \left\{ \log f(x_i) - \log (1-F(C_{Li})) \right\} + \sum_{R}\left\{ \log (1-F(C_{Ui}))- \log (1-\mathrm{F}(C_{Li})) \right\}\\
&= \sum_{E} (-\log \theta -(x_i-C_{Li})/\theta ) -\sum_{R} (C_{Ui}-C_{Li})/\theta .
\end{aligned}
$$

To simplify the notation, define $\delta_i = I(X_i < C_{Ui})$ to be a
binary variable that indicates right-censoring. Let
$X_i^{\ast \ast} = \min(X_i, C_{Ui}) - C_{Li}$ be the amount that the
observed variable exceeds the lower truncation limit. With this, the
log-likelihood is

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
l(\theta) =  - \sum_{i=1}^n \left((1-\delta_i) \log \theta + \frac{x_i^{\ast \ast}}{\theta}\right)
(\#eq:EXPloglik)
\end{equation}
```
Taking derivatives with respect to the parameter $\theta$ and setting it
equal to zero yields the maximum likelihood estimator

$$
\widehat{\theta}  = \frac{1}{n_u} \sum_{i=1}^n  x_i^{\ast \ast},
$$

where $n_u = \sum_i (1-\delta_i)$ is the number of uncensored
observations.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.2.2. Actuarial Exam Question.** You are given:

(i) A sample of losses is: 600 700 900
(ii) No information is available about losses of 500 or less.
(iii) Losses are assumed to follow an exponential distribution with mean
      $\theta$.

Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$.

`r HideExample('5.2.2', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** These observations are truncated at 500. The contribution
of each observation to the likelihood function is
$$\frac{f(x)}{1-F(500)} = \frac{\theta^{-1}e^{-x/\theta}}{e^{-500/\theta}}.$$

Then the likelihood function is

$$L(\theta)= \frac{\theta^{-1} e^{-600/\theta} \theta^{-1} e^{-700/\theta} \theta^{-1} e^{-900/\theta}}{(e^{-500/\theta})^3} = \theta^{-3}e^{-700/\theta}.$$

The log-likelihood is

$$
l(\theta) = \log L(\theta) = -3 \log \theta - 700 \theta^{-1}.
$$

Maximizing this expression by setting the derivative with respect to
$\theta$ equal to 0, we have

$$
L'(\theta) = -3 \theta^{-1} + 700 \theta^{-2} = 0 \ \Rightarrow \ \hat{\theta} = \frac{700}{3} = 233.33 .
$$

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.2.3. Actuarial Exam Question.** You are given the following
information about a random sample:

(i) The sample size equals five.
(ii) The sample is from a Weibull distribution with $\tau=2$.
(iii) Two of the sample observations are known to exceed 50, and the
      remaining three observations are 20, 30, and 45.

Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of $\theta$.

`r HideExample('5.2.3', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** The likelihood function is

$$
\begin{aligned} 
L(\theta) &= f(20) f(30) f(45) [1-F(50)]^2 \\
&= \frac{2(20/\theta)^2 e^{-(20/\theta)^2}}{20} \frac{2(30/\theta)^2 e^{-(30/\theta)^2}}{30} \frac{2(45/\theta)^2 e^{-(45/\theta)^2}}{45}(e^{-(50/\theta)^2})^2 \\
&\propto \frac{1}{\theta^6} e^{-8325/\theta^2}.
\end{aligned}
$$

The natural logarithm of the above expression is
$-6\log\theta - \frac{8325}{\theta^2}$. Maximizing this expression by
setting its derivative to 0, we get

$$\frac{-6}{\theta} + \frac{16650}{\theta^3} = 0 \ \Rightarrow \ \hat{\theta} = \left(\frac{16650}{6}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} = 52.6783.$$

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Nonparametric Estimation using Modified Data {#S:MS:NonParModified}

It can be useful to calibrate parametric estimators with nonparametric
methods that do not rely on a parametric form of the distribution. In
particular, empirical distribution functions provide useful benchmarks,
so it is helpful to understand the estimation procedures for grouped,
censored, and truncated data.

#### Grouped Data

As we have seen in Section \@ref(S:MS:GroupedData), observations may be
grouped (also referred to as interval censored) in the sense that we
only observe them as belonging in one of $k$ intervals of the form
$(c_{j-1}, c_j]$, for $j=1, \ldots, k$. At the boundaries, the empirical
distribution function is defined in the same way as Section
\@ref(S:MS:NonParInf): $$
F_n(c_j) = \frac{\text{number of observations } \le c_j}{n}.
$$

**Ogive Estimator.** For other values of $x \in (c_{j-1}, c_j)$, we can
estimate the distribution function with the
`r Gloss('ogive estimator')`, which linearly interpolates between
$F_n(c_{j-1})$ and $F_n(c_j)$, i.e. the values of the boundaries
$F_n(c_{j-1})$ and $F_n(c_j)$ are connected with a straight line. This
can formally be expressed as
$$F_n(x) = \frac{c_j-x}{c_j-c_{j-1}} F_n(c_{j-1}) + \frac{x-c_{j-1}}{c_j-c_{j-1}} F_n(c_j) \ \ \ \text{for } c_{j-1} \le x < c_j\,.$$

The corresponding density is

$$
f_n(x) = F^{\prime}_n(x) = \frac{F_n(c_j)-F_n(c_{j-1})}{c_j - c_{j-1}} \ \ \  \text{for } c_{j-1} < x < c_j .
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.2.4. Actuarial Exam Question.** You are given the following
information regarding claim sizes for 100 claims:

$$
{\small
\begin{array}{r|c}
\hline
\text{Claim Size} &  \text{Number of Claims} \\
\hline
0 - 1,000 & 16 \\
1,000 - 3,000 & 22 \\
3,000 - 5,000 & 25 \\
5,000 - 10,000 & 18 \\
10,000 - 25,000 & 10 \\
25,000 - 50,000 & 5 \\
50,000 - 100,000 & 3 \\
\text{over  } 100,000 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
}
$$

Use the ogive estimator to approximate the probability that a randomly
chosen claim is between 2000 and 6000.

`r HideExample('5.2.4', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** At the boundaries, the empirical distribution function is
defined in the usual way, so we have
$$F_{100}(1000) = 0.16, \ F_{100}(3000)=0.38, \ F_{100}(5000)=0.63, \ F_{100}(10000)=0.81.$$
For other claim sizes, the ogive estimator linearly interpolates between
these values:

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
F_{100}(2000) &= 0.5F_{100}(1000) + 0.5F_{100}(3000) = 0.5(0.16)+0.5(0.38)=0.27 \\
F_{100}(6000) &=0.8F_{100}(5000)+0.2F_{100}(10000) = 0.8(0.63)+0.2(0.81)=0.666.
\end{array}
$$

Thus, the probability that a claim is between 2000 and 6000 is
$F_{100}(6000) - F_{100}(2000) = 0.666-0.27 = 0.396$.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Right-Censored Empirical Distribution Function {#S:MS:RightCensored}

For right-censored data, the `r Gloss("product-limit estimator")` due to
[@kaplan1958] is a well-known estimator of the empirical distribution
function.

**Motivation for the Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Estimator.** To explain
why the product-limit works so well with censored observations, let us
first return to the "usual" case without censoring. From Section
\@ref(S:MS:NonParInf), the empirical distribution function $F_n(x)$ is
an *unbiased* estimator of the distribution function $F(x)$. This is
because $F_n(x)$ is the average of indicator variables each of which are
unbiased. That is, $\mathrm{E~} [I(X_i \le x)] = \Pr(X_i \le x) = F(x)$.

Now suppose the random outcome is censored on the right by a limiting
amount, say, $C_U$, so that we record the smaller of the two,
$X^* = \min(X, C_U)$. For values of $x$ that are smaller than $C_U$, the
indicator variable still provides an unbiased estimator of the
distribution function before we reach the censoring limit. That is,
$\mathrm{E~} [I(X^* \le x)] = F(x)$ because $I(X^* \le x) = I(X \le x)$
for $x < C_U$. In the same way,
$\mathrm{E~} [I(X^* > x)] = 1 -F(x) = S(x)$, making $1-F_n(x)$ an
unbiased estimator of the *survival function* $S(x)=1-F(x)$. But, for
$x>C_U$, $I(X^* \le x)$ is in general not an unbiased estimator of
$F(x)$.

As an alternative, consider *two* random variables that have different
censoring limits. For illustration, suppose that we observe
$X_1^* = \min(X_1, 5)$ and $X_2^* = \min(X_2, 10)$ where $X_1$ and $X_2$
are independent draws from the same distribution. For $x \le 5$, the
empirical distribution function $F_2(x)$ is an unbiased estimator of
$F(x)$. However, for $5 < x \le 10$, the first observation cannot be
used for the distribution function because of the censoring limitation.
Instead, the strategy developed by [@kaplan1958] uses $S_2(5)$ as an
estimator of $S(5)$ and then use the second observation to estimate the
survival function conditional on survival to time 5,
$\Pr(X > x | X >5) = \frac{S(x)}{S(5)}$. Specifically, for
$5 < x \le 10$, the estimator of the survival function is

$$
\hat{S}(x) = S_2(5) \times I(X_2^* > x ) .
$$

**Kaplan-Meier Product Limit Estimator.** Extending this idea, for each
observation $i$, let $u_i$ be the upper censoring limit ($=\infty$ if no
censoring). Thus, the recorded value is $x_i$ in the case of no
censoring and $u_i$ if there is censoring. Let $t_{1} <\cdots< t_{k}$ be
$k$ distinct points at which an uncensored loss occurs, and let $s_j$ be
the number of uncensored losses $x_i$'s at $t_{j}$. The corresponding
`r Gloss('risk set')` is the number of observations that are active (not
censored) at a value *less than* $t_{j}$, denoted as
$R_j = \sum_{i=1}^n I(x_i \geq t_{j}) + \sum_{i=1}^n I(u_i \geq t_{j})$.

With this notation, the **product-limit estimator** of the distribution
function is

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\hat{F}(x) =
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0 & x<t_{1} \\
1-\prod_{j:t_{j} \leq x}\left( 1-\frac{s_j}{R_{j}}\right) & x \geq t_{1} 
\end{array}
\right. .
(\#eq:KaplanMeier)
\end{equation}
```

For example, if $x$ is smaller than the smallest uncensored loss, then
$x<t_1$ and $\hat{F}(x) =0$. As another example, if $x$ falls between
the second and third smallest uncensored losses, then $x \in (t_2,t_3]$
and
$\hat{F}(x) = 1 - \left(1- \frac{s_1}{R_{1}}\right)\left(1- \frac{s_2}{R_{2}}\right)$.

As usual, the corresponding estimator of the survival function is
$\hat{S}(x) = 1 - \hat{F}(x)$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.2.5. Actuarial Exam Question.** The following is a sample of
10 payments:

$$
\begin{array}{cccccccccc}
4 &4 &5+ &5+ &5+ &8 &10+ &10+ &12 &15 \\
\end{array}
$$

where $+$ indicates that a loss has exceeded the policy limit.

Using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator, calculate the
probability that the loss on a policy exceeds 11, $\hat{S}(11)$.

`r HideExample('5.2.5', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** There are four event times (non-censored observations).
For each time $t_j$, we can calculate the number of events $s_j$ and the
risk set $R_j$ as the following:

$$
\begin{array}{cccc}
\hline
j & t_j & s_j & R_j \\
\hline
1 & 4 & 2 & 10 \\
2 & 8 & 1 & 5 \\
3 & 12 & 1 & 2 \\
4 & 15 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Thus, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of $S(11)$ is $$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{S}(11) &= \prod_{j:t_j\leq 11} \left( 1- \frac{s_j}{R_j} \right) =  \prod_{j=1}^{2} \left( 1- \frac{s_j}{R_j} \right)\\
&= \left(1-\frac{2}{10} \right) \left(1-\frac{1}{5} \right) = (0.8)(0.8)= 0.64. \\
\end{aligned}
$$

**Example 5.2.6. Bodily Injury Claims.** We consider again the Boston
auto bodily injury claims data from @derrig2001applications that was
introduced in Example 5.1.6. In that example, we omitted the
`r sum(BIData$Censored)` claims that were censored by policy limits.
Now, we include the full dataset and use the Kaplan-Meier product limit
to estimate the survival function. This is given in Figure
\@ref(fig:KMSurvival).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Right-Censored, Left-Truncated Empirical Distribution Function.** In
addition to right-censoring, we now extend the framework to allow for
left-truncated data. As before, for each observation $i$, let $u_i$ be
the upper censoring limit ($=\infty$ if no censoring). Further, let
$d_i$ be the lower truncation limit (0 if no truncation). Thus, the
recorded value (if it is greater than $d_i$) is $x_i$ in the case of no
censoring and $u_i$ if there is censoring. Let $t_{1} <\cdots< t_{k}$ be
$k$ distinct points at which an event of interest occurs, and let $s_j$
be the number of recorded events $x_i$'s at time point $t_{j}$. The
corresponding risk set is
$$R_j = \sum_{i=1}^n I(x_i \geq t_{j}) + \sum_{i=1}^n I(u_i \geq t_{j}) - \sum_{i=1}^n I(d_i \geq t_{j}).$$

With this new definition of the risk set, the product-limit estimator of
the distribution function can be obtained using equation
\@ref(eq:KaplanMeier).

**Greenwood's Formula**. For statistical inference, [@greenwood1926]
derived the formula for the estimated variance of the product-limit
estimator as

$$
\widehat{Var}(\hat{F}(x)) = (1-\hat{F}(x))^{2} \sum _{j:t_{j} \leq x} \dfrac{s_j}{R_{j}(R_{j}-s_j)}.
$$

As usual, we refer to the square root of the estimated variance as the
*standard error*, a quantity that is routinely used in confidence
intervals and for hypothesis testing (see, e.g., Appendix Section
\@ref(S:AppA:IE)). To compute this, the `survfit` function in `R` takes
a survival data object and creates a new object containing the
Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function along with confidence
intervals. The Kaplan-Meier method (`type='kaplan-meier'`) is used by
default to construct an estimate of the survival curve. The resulting
discrete survival function has point masses at the observed event times
(discharge dates) $t_j$, where the probability of an event given
survival to that duration is estimated as the number of observed events
at the duration $s_j$ divided by the number of subjects exposed or
'at-risk' just prior to the event duration $R_j$.

**Alternative Estimators**. Two alternate types of estimators are
available for the `survfit` function. The alternative (`type='fh2'`)
handles ties, in essence, by assuming that multiple events at the same
duration occur in some arbitrary order. Another alternative
(`type='fleming-harrington'`) uses the `r Gloss("Nelson-Aalen")`
[@aalen1978] estimator of the **cumulative hazard function** to obtain
an estimate of the survival function. The estimated cumulative hazard
$\hat{H}(x)$ starts at zero and is incremented at each observed event
duration $t_j$ by the number of events $s_j$ divided by the number at
risk $R_j$. With the same notation as above, the **Nelson-Äalen**
estimator of the distribution function is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{F}_{NA}(x) &=
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0 & x<t_{1} \\
1- \exp \left(-\sum_{j:t_{j} \leq x}\frac{s_j}{R_j} \right) & x \geq t_{1} 
\end{array}
\right. .\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the above expression is a result of the Nelson-Äalen estimator
of the cumulative hazard function
$$\hat{H}(x)=\sum_{j:t_j\leq x}  \frac{s_j}{R_j},$$and the relationship
between the survival function and cumulative hazard function is
$\hat{S}_{NA}(x)=e^{-\hat{H}(x)}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.2.7. Actuarial Exam Question.**

For observation $i$ of a survival study:

-   $d_i$ is the left truncation point
-   $x_i$ is the observed value if not right censored
-   $u_i$ is the observed value if right censored

You are given:

$$
{\small
\begin{array}{c|cccccccccc}
\hline
\text{Observation } (i) & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10\\ \hline
d_i & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1.3 & 1.5 & 1.6\\
x_i & 0.9 & - & 1.5 & - & - & 1.7 & - & 2.1 & 2.1 & - \\
u_i & - & 1.2 & - & 1.5 & 1.6 & - & 1.7 & - & - & 2.3 \\
\hline
\end{array}
}
$$

Calculate the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate, $\hat{S}(1.6)$

`r HideExample('5.2.7', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** Recall the risk set
$R_j = \sum_{i=1}^n \left\{ I(x_i \geq t_{j}) + I(u_i \geq t_{j}) - I(d_i \geq t_{j}) \right\}$.
Then

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\hline
j & t_j & s_j & R_j & \hat{S}(t_j) \\
\hline
1  & 0.9   & 1   & 10-3 = 7 & 1-\frac{1}{7} = \frac{6}{7} \\
2  & 1.5   & 1   & 8-2 = 6  & \frac{6}{7}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{6} \right) = \frac{5}{7}\\
3  & 1.7   & 1   & 5-0 = 5  & \frac{5}{7}\left( 1 - \frac{1}{5} \right) = \frac{4}{7}\\
4  & 2.1   & 2   & 3        & \frac{4}{7}\left( 1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{4}{21}\\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The Kaplan-Meier estimate is therefore $\hat{S}(1.6) = \frac{5}{7}$.

</div>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.2.8. Actuarial Exam Question. - Continued.**

a)  Using the Nelson-Äalen estimator, calculate the probability that the
    loss on a policy exceeds 11, $\hat{S}_{NA}(11)$.
b)  Calculate Greenwood's approximation to the variance of the
    product-limit estimate $\hat{S}(11)$.

`r HideExample('5.2.8', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** As before, there are four event times (non-censored
observations). For each time $t_j$, we can calculate the number of
events $s_j$ and the risk set $R_j$ as the following:

$$
\begin{array}{cccc}
\hline
j & t_j & s_j & R_j \\
\hline
1 & 4 & 2 & 10 \\
2 & 8 & 1 & 5 \\
3 & 12 & 1 & 2 \\
4 & 15 & 1 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The Nelson-Äalen estimate of $S(11)$ is
$\hat{S}_{NA}(11)=e^{-\hat{H}(11)} = e^{-0.4} = 0.67$, since $$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{H}(11) &= \sum_{j:t_j\leq 11} \frac{s_j}{R_j}  = \sum_{j=1}^{2} \frac{s_j}{R_j}  \\
&= \frac{2}{10} + \frac{1}{5}  = 0.2 + 0.2 = 0.4 .\\
\end{aligned}
$$

From earlier work, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of $S(11)$ is
$\hat{S}(11) = 0.64$. Then Greenwood's estimate of the variance of the
product-limit estimate of $S(11)$ is $$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{Var}(\hat{S}(11)) &= (\hat{S}(11))^2 \sum_{j:t_j\leq 11} \frac{s_j}{R_j(R_j-s_j)}
&= (0.64)^2 \left(\frac{2}{10(8)} + \frac{1}{5(4)} \right)  = 0.0307. \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Model Selection {#S:MS:ModelSelection}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, you learn how to:

-   Determine measures that summarize deviations of a parametric from a nonparametric fit 
-   Describe the iterative model selection specification process 
-   Outline steps needed to select a parametric model 
-   Describe pitfalls of model selection based purely on in-sample data when compared to the advantages of out-of-sample model validation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to nonparametric tools for model selection based on marginal
distributions of outcomes ignoring explanatory variables, this section
underscores the idea that model selection is an iterative process in
which models are cyclically (re)formulated and tested for
appropriateness before using them for inference. After an overview, we
describe the `r Gloss('model selection')` process from Section
\@ref(S:Process) based on:

-   an `r Gloss("in-sample")` or training dataset,
-   an `r Gloss("out-of-sample")` or test dataset, and
-   a method that combines these approaches known as
    `r Gloss("cross-validation")`.

### Tools for Model Selection and Diagnostics {#S:MS:ToolsModelSelection}

Section \@ref(S:MS:NonParInf) introduced nonparametric estimators in
which there was no parametric form assumed about the underlying
distributions. However, in many actuarial applications, analysts seek to
employ a parametric fit of a distribution for ease of explanation and
the ability to readily extend it to more complex situations such as
including explanatory variables in a regression setting. When fitting a
parametric distribution, one analyst might try to use a gamma
distribution to represent a set of loss data. However, another analyst
may prefer to use a Pareto distribution. How does one determine which
model to select?

Nonparametric tools can be used to corroborate the selection of
parametric models. Essentially, the approach is to compute selected
summary measures under a fitted parametric model and to compare it to
the corresponding quantity under the nonparametric model. As the
nonparametric model does not assume a specific distribution and is
merely a function of the data, it is used as a benchmark to assess how
well the parametric distribution/model represents the data. Also, as the
sample size increases, the empirical distribution converges almost
surely to the underlying population distribution (by the strong law of
large numbers). Thus the empirical distribution is a good proxy for the
population. The comparison of parametric to nonparametric estimators may
alert the analyst to deficiencies in the parametric model and sometimes
point ways to improving the parametric specification. Procedures geared
towards assessing the validity of a model are known as
`r Gloss('model diagnostics')`.

#### Graphical Comparison of Distributions {#S:MS:GraphComparison}

We have already seen the technique of overlaying graphs for comparison
purposes. To reinforce the application of this technique, Figure
\@ref(fig:ComparisonCDFPDF) compares the empirical distribution to two
parametric fitted distributions. The left panel shows the distribution
functions of claims distributions. The dots forming an "S-shaped" curve
represent the empirical distribution function at each observation. The
thick blue curve gives corresponding values for the fitted gamma
distribution and the light purple is for the fitted Pareto distribution.
Because the Pareto is much closer to the empirical distribution function
than the gamma, this provides evidence that the Pareto is the better
model for this dataset. The right panel gives similar information for
the density function and provides a consistent message. Based (only) on
these figures, the Pareto distribution is the clear choice for the
analyst.

(ref:ComparisonCDFPDF) **Nonparametric Versus Fitted Parametric Distribution and Density Functions. The left-hand panel compares distribution functions, with the dots corresponding to the empiricaldistribution, the thick blue curve corresponding to the fitted gamma and the light purple curve corresponding to the fitted Pareto. The right hand panel compares these three distributions summarized using probability density functions. **

```{r ComparisonCDFPDF, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:ComparisonCDFPDF)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.60, fig.align='center'}
library(MASS)
library(VGAM)
# Inference assuming a gamma distribution
fit.gamma2 <- glm(Claim~1, data=ClaimData,family=Gamma(link=log))
#summary(fit.gamma2, dispersion = gamma.dispersion(fit.gamma2))

theta<-exp(coef(fit.gamma2))*gamma.dispersion(fit.gamma2) #mu=theta/alpha
alpha<-1/gamma.dispersion(fit.gamma2)

#  Inference assuming a Pareto Distribution
fit.pareto <- vglm(Claim ~ 1, paretoII, loc=0, data = ClaimData)
#summary(fit.pareto)
#head(fitted(fit.pareto))
#exp(coef(fit.pareto))

x <- seq(0,15,by=0.01)

par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
LogPercentiles  <- ecdf(log(ClaimData$Claim))
plot(LogPercentiles,  main="", xlab="Log Claims", ylab="Distribution Function", cex=1)
Fgamma_ex = pgamma(exp(x), shape = alpha, scale=theta)
lines(x,Fgamma_ex,col="blue")
Fpareto_ex = pparetoII(exp(x),loc=0,shape = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[2]), scale = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[1]))
lines(x,Fpareto_ex,col="purple")
legend("bottomright", c("log(claims)", "Gamma","Pareto"), lty=1, cex=0.6,col = c("black","blue","purple"))

plot(density(log(ClaimData$Claim)) ,main="", xlab="Log Claims")
fgamma_ex = dgamma(exp(x), shape = alpha, scale=theta)*exp(x)
lines(x,fgamma_ex,col="blue")
fpareto_ex = dparetoII(exp(x),loc=0,shape = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[2]), scale = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[1]))*exp(x)
lines(x,fpareto_ex,col="purple")
legend("topright", c("log(claims)", "Gamma","Pareto"), lty=1, cex=0.6,col = c("black","blue","purple"))
```

For another way to compare the appropriateness of two fitted models,
consider the `r Gloss("probability-probability (pp) plot")`. A $pp$ plot
compares cumulative probabilities under two models. For our purposes,
these two models are the nonparametric empirical distribution function
and the parametric fitted model. Figure \@ref(fig:PPPlot) shows $pp$
plots for the Property Fund data introduced in Section \@ref(S:LGPIF).
The fitted gamma is on the left and the fitted Pareto is on the right,
compared to the same empirical distribution function of the data. The
straight line represents equality between the two distributions being
compared, so points close to the line are desirable. As seen in earlier
demonstrations, the Pareto is much closer to the empirical distribution
than the gamma, providing additional evidence that the Pareto is the
better model.

(ref:PPPlot) **Probability-Probability ($pp$) Plots. The horizontal axis gives the empirical distribution function at each observation. In the left-hand panel, the corresponding distribution function for the gamma is shown in the vertical axis. The right-hand panel shows the fitted Pareto distribution. Lines of $y=x$ are superimposed.**

```{r PPPlot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:PPPlot)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=0.60, fig.align='center'}
#  PP Plot
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
Fgamma_ex = pgamma(ClaimData$Claim, shape = alpha, scale=theta)
#plot(Percentiles(ClaimData$Claim),Fgamma_ex, xlab="Empirical DF", ylab="Gamma DF",cex=0.4)
Fn <- ecdf(ClaimData$Claim)
plot(Fn(ClaimData$Claim), Fgamma_ex, xlab="Empirical DF", ylab="Gamma DF", cex=0.4)
abline(0,1)

Fpareto_ex = pparetoII(ClaimData$Claim,loc=0,shape = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[2]), scale = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[1]))
#plot(Percentiles(ClaimData$Claim),Fpareto_ex, xlab="Empirical DF", ylab="Pareto DF",cex=0.4)
plot(Fn(ClaimData$Claim), Fpareto_ex, xlab="Empirical DF", ylab="Pareto DF", cex=0.4)
abline(0,1)
```

A $pp$ plot is useful in part because no artificial scaling is required,
such as with the overlaying of densities in Figure
\@ref(fig:ComparisonCDFPDF), in which we switched to the log scale to
better visualize the data. The Chapter 5 *Technical Supplement A.1*
introduces a variation of the $pp$ plot known as a
`r Gloss('Lorenz curve')`; this is an important tool for assessing
income inequality. Furthermore, $pp$ plots are available in multivariate
settings where more than one outcome variable is available. However, a
limitation of the $pp$ plot is that, because it plots *cumulative*
distribution functions, it can sometimes be difficult to detect *where*
a fitted parametric distribution is deficient. As an alternative, it is
common to use a `r Gloss("quantile-quantile (qq) plot")`, as
demonstrated in Figure \@ref(fig:QQPlot).

The $qq$ plot compares two fitted models through their quantiles. As
with $pp$ plots, we compare the nonparametric to a parametric fitted
model. Quantiles may be evaluated at each point of the dataset, or on a
grid (e.g., at $0, 0.001, 0.002, \ldots, 0.999, 1.000$), depending on
the application. In Figure \@ref(fig:QQPlot), for each point on the
aforementioned grid, the horizontal axis displays the empirical quantile
and the vertical axis displays the corresponding fitted parametric
quantile (gamma for the upper two panels, Pareto for the lower two).
Quantiles are plotted on the original scale in the left panels and on
the log scale in the right panels to allow us to see where a fitted
distribution is deficient. The straight line represents equality between
the empirical distribution and fitted distribution. From these plots, we
again see that the Pareto is an overall better fit than the gamma.
Furthermore, the lower-right panel suggests that the Pareto distribution
does a good job with large claims, but provides a poorer fit for small
claims.

(ref:QQPlot) **Quantile-Quantile ($qq$) Plots. The horizontal axis gives the empirical quantiles at each observation. The right-hand panels they are graphed on a logarithmic basis. The vertical axis gives the quantiles from the fitted distributions; gamma quantiles are in the upper panels, Pareto quantiles are in the lower panels.**

```{r QQPlot, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:QQPlot)', out.width='80%', fig.asp=0.90, fig.align='center'}
#q-q plot
options(scipen=10)
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
xseq = seq(0.0001, 0.9999, by=1/length(ClaimData$Claim))
empquant = quantile(ClaimData$Claim, xseq)
Gammaquant = qgamma(xseq, shape = alpha, scale=theta)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.3.1. Actuarial Exam Question.** The graph below shows a $pp$
plot of a fitted distribution compared to a sample.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap='', out.width='40%', fig.asp=1, fig.align='center'}
# set of points
x <- c(    0, 0.1, 0.2,  0.25, 0.4,  0.5,  0.6,  0.7,  0.8, 0.85, 0.9,  1)
y <- c(-0.05, 0.3, 0.23, 0.25, 0.33, 0.38, 0.41, 0.46, 0.7, 0.85, 0.95, 1)
lo <- loess(y~x)
xl <- seq(min(x),max(x), (max(x) - min(x))/1000)
plot(xl, predict(lo,xl), type="l", xlab="Sample", ylab="Fitted", cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5)

abline(0,1)
```

Comment on the two distributions with respect to left tail, right tail,
and median probabilities.

`r HideExample('5.3.1', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** The tail of the fitted distribution is too thick on the
left, too thin on the right, and the fitted distribution has less
probability around the median than the sample. To see this, recall that
the $pp$ plot graphs the cumulative distribution of two distributions on
its axes (empirical on the x-axis and fitted on the y-axis in this
case). For small values of $x$, the fitted model assigns greater
probability to being below that value than occurred in the sample (i.e.
$F(x) > F_n(x)$). This indicates that the model has a heavier left tail
than the data. For large values of $x$, the model again assigns greater
probability to being below that value and thus less probability to being
above that value (i.e. $S(x) < S_n(x)$). This indicates that the model
has a lighter right tail than the data. In addition, as we go from 0.4
to 0.6 on the horizontal axis (thus looking at the middle 20% of the
data), the $pp$ plot increases from about 0.3 to 0.4. This indicates
that the model puts only about 10% of the probability in this range.

#### Statistical Comparison of Distributions {#S:MS:Tools:Stats}

When selecting a model, it is helpful to make the graphical displays
presented. However, for reporting results, it can be effective to
supplement the graphical displays with selected statistics that
summarize model goodness of fit. [Table 5.2](#tab:5.2) provides three
commonly used `r Gloss('goodness of fit statistics')`. In this table,
$F_n$ is the empirical distribution, $F$ is the fitted or hypothesized
distribution, and $F_i^* = F(x_i)$.

<a id=tab:5.2></a>

Table 5.2. **Three Goodness of Fit Statistics**

$$
{\small
\begin{matrix}
\begin{array}{l|cc}
\hline
\text{Statistic} & \text{Definition} & \text{Computational Expression} \\
\hline
\text{Kolmogorov-} & \max_x |F_n(x) - F(x)| & \max(D^+, D^-) \text{ where } \\
~~~\text{Smirnov} && D^+ = \max_{i=1, \ldots, n} \left|\frac{i}{n} - F_i^*\right| \\
&& D^- = \max_{i=1, \ldots, n} \left| F_i^* - \frac{i-1}{n} \right| \\
\text{Cramer-von Mises} & n \int (F_n(x) - F(x))^2 f(x) dx & \frac{1}{12n} + \sum_{i=1}^n \left(F_i^* - (2i-1)/n\right)^2 \\
\text{Anderson-Darling} & n \int \frac{(F_n(x) - F(x))^2}{F(x)(1-F(x))} f(x) dx & -n-\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (2i-1) \log\left(F_i^*(1-F_{n+1-i})\right)^2 \\
\hline
\end{array} \\
\end{matrix}
}
$$

The *Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic* is the maximum absolute difference
between the fitted distribution function and the empirical distribution
function. Instead of comparing differences between single points, the
*Cramer-von Mises statistic* integrates the difference between the
empirical and fitted distribution functions over the entire range of
values. The *Anderson-Darling statistic* also integrates this difference
over the range of values, although weighted by the inverse of the
variance. It therefore places greater emphasis on the tails of the
distribution (i.e when $F(x)$ or $1-F(x)=S(x)$ is small).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.3.2. Actuarial Exam Question (modified).** A sample of claim
payments is:

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
29 & 64 & 90 & 135 & 182  \\
\end{array}
$$

Compare the empirical claims distribution to an exponential distribution
with mean $100$ by calculating the value of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
statistic.

`r HideExample('5.3.2', 'Show Example Solution')`

**Solution.** For an exponential distribution with mean $100$, the
cumulative distribution function is $F(x)=1-e^{-x/100}$. Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\hline
x & F(x) & F_n(x) & F_n(x-) & \max(|F(x)-F_n(x)|,|F(x)-F_n(x-)|) \\
\hline
29  & 0.2517 & 0.2 & 0   & \max(0.0517, 0.2517) = 0.2517 \\
64  & 0.4727 & 0.4 & 0.2 & \max(0.0727, 0.2727) = 0.2727 \\
90  & 0.5934 & 0.6 & 0.4 & \max(0.0066, 0.1934) = 0.1934 \\
135 & 0.7408 & 0.8 & 0.6 & \max(0.0592, 0.1408) = 0.1408 \\
182 & 0.8380 & 1   & 0.8 & \max(0.1620, 0.0380) = 0.1620 \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic is therefore

$$
KS = \max(0.2517, 0.2727, 0.1934, 0.1408, 0.1620) = 0.2727 .
$$

### Iterative Model Selection {#S:MS:Iterative:Selection}

In our model development, we examine the data graphically, hypothesize a
model structure, and compare the data to a candidate model in order to
formulate an improved model. @box1980sampling describes this as an
*iterative process* which is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:Iterative).

(ref:Iterative) **Iterative Model Specification Process**

```{r Iterative, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:Iterative)', out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/F5Iterative.png")
```

This iterative process provides a useful recipe for structuring the task
of specifying a model to represent a set of data.

1.  The first step, the model formulation stage, is accomplished by
    examining the data graphically and using prior knowledge of
    relationships, such as from economic theory or industry practice.
2.  The second step in the iteration is fitting based on the assumptions
    of the specified model. These assumptions must be consistent with
    the data to make valid use of the model.
3.  The third step is *diagnostic checking*; the data and model must be
    consistent with one another before additional inferences can be
    made. Diagnostic checking is an important part of the model
    formulation; it can reveal mistakes made in previous steps and
    provide ways to correct these mistakes.

The iterative process also emphasizes the skills you need to make data
analytics work. First, you need a willingness to summarize information
numerically and portray this information graphically. Second, it is
important to develop an understanding of model properties. You should
understand how a probabilistic model behaves in order to match a set of
data to it. Third, theoretical properties of the model are also
important for inferring general relationships based on the behavior of
the data.

### Model Selection Based on a Training Dataset {#S:MS:Tools:Stats:Likelihood}

As introduced in Section \@ref(S:Process), it is common to refer to a
dataset used for fitting the model as a *training* or an *in-sample*
dataset. Techniques available for selecting a model depend upon whether
the outcomes $X$ are discrete, continuous, or a hybrid of the two,
although the principles are the same.

**Graphical and other Basic Summary Measures.** Begin by summarizing the
data graphically and with statistics that do not rely on a specific
parametric form, as summarized in Section \@ref(S:MS:NonParInf) above.
Specifically, you will want to graph both the empirical distribution and
density functions. Particularly for loss data that contain many zeros
and that can be skewed, deciding on the appropriate scale (e.g.,
logarithmic) may present some difficulties. For discrete data, tables
are often preferred. Determine sample moments, such as the mean and
variance, as well as selected quantiles, including the minimum, maximum,
and the median. For discrete data, the mode (or most frequently
occurring value) is usually helpful.

These summaries, as well as your familiarity of industry practice, will
suggest one or more candidate parametric models. Generally, start with
the simpler parametric models (for example, one parameter exponential
before a two parameter gamma), gradually introducing more complexity
into the modeling process.

Critique the candidate parametric model numerically and graphically. For
the graphs, utilize the tools introduced in Section
\@ref(S:MS:ToolsModelSelection) such as $pp$ and $qq$ plots. For the
numerical assessments, examine the statistical significance of
parameters and try to eliminate parameters that do not provide
additional information. In addition to statistical significance of
parameters, you may use the following model comparison tools.

**Likelihood Ratio Tests.** For comparing model fits, if one model is a
subset of another, then a likelihood ratio test may be employed; the
general approach to likelihood ratio testing is described in Appendix
Sections \@ref(S:AppA:HT:LRT) and \@ref(S:AppC:MLEModelVal).

**Goodness of Fit Statistics.** Generally, models are not proper subsets
of one another in which case overall goodness of fit statistics are
helpful for comparing models. *Information criteria* are one type of
goodness of statistic. The most widely used examples are Akaike's
Information Criterion (*AIC*) and the (Schwarz) Bayesian Information
Criterion (*BIC*); they are widely cited because they can be readily
generalized to multivariate settings. Appendix Section
\@ref(S:AppA:HT:IC) provides a summary of these statistics.

For selecting the appropriate distribution, statistics that compare a
parametric fit to a nonparametric alternative, summarized in Section
\@ref(S:MS:Tools:Stats), are useful for model comparison. For discrete
data, a *goodness of fit* statistic (as described in Section
\@ref(S:goodness-of-fit)) is generally preferred as it is more intuitive
and simpler to explain.

### Model Selection Based on a Test Dataset

`r Gloss('Model validation')` introduced in Section \@ref(S:Process) is
the process of confirming that the proposed model is appropriate based
on a *test* or an *out-of-sample* dataset, especially in light of the
purposes of the investigation. Model validation is important since the
model selection process based only on training or in-sample data can be
susceptible to `r Gloss("data-snooping")`, that is, fitting a great
number of models to a single set of data. By looking at a large number
of models, we may overfit the data and understate the natural variation
in our representation.

Selecting a model based only on in-sample data also does not support the
goal of `r Gloss('predictive inference')`. Particularly in actuarial
applications, our goal is to make statements about *new* experience
rather than a dataset at hand. For example, we use claims experience
from one year to develop a model that can be used to price insurance
contracts for the following year. As an analogy, we can think about the
training dataset as experience from one year that is used to predict the
behavior of the next year's test dataset.

We can respond to these criticisms by using a technique known as
**out-of-sample validation**. The ideal situation is to have available
two sets of data, one for training, or model development, and the other
for testing, or model validation. We initially develop one or several
models on the first dataset that we call *candidate* models. Then, the
relative performance of the candidate models can be measured on the
second set of data. In this way, the data used to validate the model are
unaffected by the procedures used to formulate the model.

**Random Split of the Data.** Unfortunately, rarely will two sets of
data be available to the investigator. As mentioned in Section
\@ref(S:Process), we can implement the validation process by splitting
the dataset into **training** and **test** subsamples, respectively.
Figure \@ref(fig:ModelValidation) illustrates this splitting of the

Various researchers recommend different proportions for the allocation.
@snee1977validation suggests that data-splitting not be done unless the
sample size is moderately large. The guidelines of @picard1990data show
that the greater the number of parameters to be estimated, the greater
the proportion of observations is needed for the training subsample for
model development.

**Selecting a Distribution.** Still, our focus so far has been to select
a distribution for a dataset that can be used for actuarial modeling
without additional explanatory or input variables $x_1, \ldots, x_k$.
Even in this more fundamental problem, the model validation approach is
valuable. If we base all inference on only in-sample data, then there is
a tendency to select more complicated models than needed. For example,
we might select a four parameter GB2, generalized beta of the second
kind, distribution when only a two parameter Pareto is needed.
Information criteria such as `r Gloss('AIC')` and `r Gloss('BIC')`
introduced in Appendix Section \@ref(S:AppA:HT:IC) include penalties for
model complexity and thus provide protection against over-fitting, but
using a test sample may also help achieve parsimonious models. From a
quote often attributed to Albert Einstein, we want to "use the simplest
model as possible but no simpler."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.3.3. Wisconsin Property Fund.** For the 2010 property fund
data from Section \@ref(S:LGPIF), we may try to select a severity
distribution based on out-of-sample prediction. In particular, we may
randomly select 1,000 observations as our training data, and use the
remaining 377 claims to validate the two models based respectively on
gamma and Pareto distributions. For illustration purposes, We compare
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics respectively for the training and test
datasets using the models fitted from training data.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, comment = "",  echo=SHOW_PDF}

library(goftest)
claim_lev <- read.csv("Data/CLAIMLEVEL.csv", header = TRUE) 
# 2010 subset 
claim_data <- subset(claim_lev, Year == 2010); 

# Randomly re-order the data - "shuffle it"
n <- nrow(claim_data)
set.seed(12345)
rdata <- claim_data[sample(n), ]

# Use training data to fit the models, and training and test data to calculate KS statistics
train.id <- 1:1000  # indices for training data

# Pareto
  fit.pareto <- vglm(Claim ~ 1, paretoII, loc = 0, data = rdata[train.id,])
  InSamplePareto <- ks.test(rdata[train.id,]$Claim, "pparetoII", loc = 0, shape = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[2]), 
        scale = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[1]))
  OutSamplePareto <- ks.test(rdata[-train.id,]$Claim, "pparetoII", loc = 0, shape = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[2]), 
        scale = exp(coef(fit.pareto)[1]))
# Gamma
  fit.gamma <- glm(Claim ~ 1, data = rdata[train.id,], family = Gamma(link = log)) 
  gamma_theta <- exp(coef(fit.gamma)) * gamma.dispersion(fit.gamma)  
  alpha <- 1 / gamma.dispersion(fit.gamma)
  InSampleGamma <- ks.test(rdata[train.id,]$Claim, "pgamma", shape = alpha, scale = gamma_theta)
  OutSampleGamma <- ks.test(rdata[-train.id,]$Claim, "pgamma", shape = alpha, scale = gamma_theta)

```

Based on in-sample prediction, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit
statistic for the gamma distribution turns out to be
`r round(InSampleGamma$statistic,digits=4)` and for the Pareto
distribution is `r round(InSamplePareto$statistic,digits=4)`. Based on
out-of-sample prediction, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit
statistic for the gamma distribution turns out to be
`r round(OutSampleGamma$statistic,digits=4)` and for the Pareto
distribution is `r round(OutSamplePareto$statistic,digits=4)`. Based on
both in-sample and out-of-sample prediction, the Pareto model seems to
give considerably better goodness of fit under the random seed used in
the code for splitting the training and test data.

**Model Validation Statistics.** In addition to the nonparametric tools
introduced earlier for comparing marginal distributions of the outcome
or output variables ignoring potential explanatory or input variables,
much of the literature supporting the establishment of a model
validation process is based on regression and classification models that
you can think of as an *input-output* problem (@james2013introduction).
That is, we have several inputs or predictor variables
$x_1, \ldots, x_k$ that are related to an output or outcome $y$ through
a function such as $$y = \mathrm{g}\left(x_1, \ldots, x_k\right).$$For
model selection, one uses the training sample to develop an estimate of
$\mathrm{g}$, say, $\hat{\mathrm{g}}$, and then calibrate the average
distance from the observed outcomes to the predictions using a criterion
of the form

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{n}\sum_i \mathrm{d}(y_i,\hat{\mathrm{g}}\left(x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ik}\right) ) .
(\#eq:OutSampleCriter)
\end{equation}
```
Here, "d" is some measure of distance and the sum $i$ is over the test
data. The function $\mathrm{g}$ may not have an analytical form and can
be estimated for each observation using the different different types of
algorithms and models introduced earlier in Section
\@ref(S:ManyVarAnalytics). In many regression applications, it is common
to use the squared Euclidean distance of the form
$\mathrm{d}(y_i,\mathrm{g}) = (y_i-\mathrm{g})^2$ under which the
criterion in equation \@ref(eq:OutSampleCriter) is called the **mean
squared error (MSE)**. Using data simulated from linear models, Example
2.3.1 uses the **root mean squared error (Rmse)** which is the squared
root of the MSE. From equation \@ref(eq:OutSampleCriter), the MSE
criteria works the best for linear models under normal distributions
with constant variance, as minimizing MSE is equivalent to the maximum
likelihood and least squares criterion in training data. In data
analytics and linear regression, one may consider transformations of the
outcome variable in order for the MSE criteria to work more effectively.
In actuarial applications, the **mean absolute error (MAE)** under the
Euclidean distance $\mathrm{d}(y_i,\mathrm{g}) = |y_i-\mathrm{g}|$ may
be preferred because of the skewed nature of loss data. For right-skewed
outcomes, it may require a larger sample size for the validation
statistics to pickup the correct model when large outlying values of $y$
can have a large effect on the measures. Following Example 2.3.1, we use
simulated data in Examples 5.3.4 through 5.3.7 to compare the AIC
information criteria from Appendix Chapter \@ref(S:AppA:HT:IC) with
out-of-sample MSE and MAE criterion for selecting the distribution and
input variables for outcomes that are respectively from normal and
right-skewed distributions including lognormal and gamma distributions.
For right skewed distributions, we find that the AIC information
criteria seems to work consistently for selecting the correct
distributional form and mean structure (input variables), whereas
out-of-sample MSE and MAE may not work for right-skewed outcomes like
those from gamma distributions, even with relatively large sample sizes.
Therefore, model validation statistics commonly used in data analytics
may only work for minimizing specific cost functions, such as the MAE
that represents the average absolute error for out-of-sample prediction,
and do not necessarily guarantee correct selection of the underlying
data generating mechanism.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.3.4. In-sample AIC and out-of-sample MSE for normal
outcomes**. Example 2.3.1 assumes that there is a set of claims that
potentially varies by a single categorical variable with six levels. To
illustrating in-sample over-fitting, it also assumes that two of the six
levels share a common mean that differs from rest of levels. For Example
2.3.1, the claim amounts were generated from a linear model with
constant variance, for which in-sample AIC and out-of-sample Rmse
provide consistent results from the cross-validation procedure to be
introduced in the next section. Here, we may use the same data
generation mechanism to compare the performance of in-sample AIC with
the in-sample and out-of-sample Rmse criteria. In particular, we
generate a total of 200 samples and split them equally into the training
and test datasets. From the output table, we observe the two-level model
was correctly selected by both in-sample AIC and out-of-sample MSE
criteria, whereas in-sample MSE prefers an over-fitted model with six
levels. Thus, due to concerns of model over-fitting, we do not use
in-sample distance measures such as the MSE and MAE criterion that
favors more complicated models.

**Example 5.3.5. MSE and MAE for right-skewed outcomes - lognormal
claims**. For claims modeling, one may wonder how the MSE and MAE types
of criterion may perform for right-skewed data. Using the same data
generating procedure, we may generate lognormal claim amounts by
exponentiating the normal outcomes from the previous example. We fit the
lognormal claim amounts with gamma and lognormal regression commonly
used for ratemaking and claims analytics. For the specific data
generating mechanism, we observe that it requires a larger sample size
for out-of-sample Rmse and MAE to select the correct distributional form
and mean structure, when compared with in-sample AIC criteria. The AIC
criteria is able to pick out the correct model with a sample size of
200, while out-of-sample MSE and MAE fail to. Thus, for right skewed
output, precautions need to be taken when using model validation
statistics that may be sensitive to large claim values, particularly
when the sample size is relatively small.

**Example 5.3.6. MSE and MAE for right-skewed outcomes - gamma claims**.
For right-skewed outcomes, we may be interested in studying how the MSE
and MAE types of measures work for another loss severity distribution,
the gamma distribution, that is widely used in ratemaking and claims
analytics. Here, we use a similar mean structure for generating claims
amounts based on a gamma regression with the log link function. We fit
the data using gamma regression and lognormal regression. For gamma
outcomes, the table shows that out-of-sample MSE and MAE criterion fail
to select the correct distributional form or the mean structure even
with a total of 1000 samples. By changing the gamma shape parameter, you
may see that the out-of-sample MSE and MAE criterion work in certain
settings for correctly selecting the distributional form or the mean
structure, but the performance of such model validation statistics does
not seem to be consistent across different parameter values and sample
sizes for right-skewed gamma outcomes. Again, the AIC criteria seems to
be working consistently in selecting the correct distribution and mean
structure for the data generated from gamma distributions, even with a
smaller sample size of 200.

Chapter \@ref(ChapPremiumFoundations) describes another measure, the
`r Gloss('Gini index', '4.2')`, that may be useful in actuarial
applications particularly when there is a large proportion of zeros in
claims data (corresponding to no claims) that may invalidate the
aforementioned model validation statistics.

### Model Selection Based on Cross-Validation {#S:MS:Cross-Validation}

Although out-of-sample validation is the gold standard in predictive
modeling, it is not always practical to do so. The main reason is that
we have limited sample sizes and the out-of-sample model selection
criterion in equation \@ref(eq:OutSampleCriter) depends on a *random*
split of the data. This means that different analysts, even when working
the same dataset and same approach to modeling, may select different
models. This is likely in actuarial applications because we work with
skewed datasets where there is a large chance of getting some very large
outcomes and large outcomes may have a great influence on the parameter
estimates.

**Cross-Validation Procedure.** Alternatively, one may use
**cross-validation**, as follows.

-   The procedure begins by using a random mechanism to split the data
    into $K$ subsets of roughly equal size known as *folds*, where
    analysts typically use 5 to 10.
-   Next, one uses the first $K$-1 subsamples to estimate model
    parameters. Then, "predict" the outcomes for the $K$th subsample and
    use a measure such as in equation \@ref(eq:OutSampleCriter) to
    summarize the fit.
-   Now, repeat this by holding out each of the $K$ subsamples,
    summarizing with an out-of-sample statistic. Thus, summarize these
    $K$ statistics, typically by averaging, to give a single overall
    statistic for comparison purposes.

Repeat these steps for several candidate models and choose the model
with the lowest overall cross-validation statistic.

In Example 2.3.1, you have seen that the MSE criteria seems to work with
k-fold cross-validation in selecting the correct mean structure for
claims outcome data generated from linear models with constant variance.
From Examples 5.3.5 and 5.3.6, however, the out-of-sample MSE and MAE
criterion does not seem to provide consistent performance for selecting
the distributional form and the mean structure under right-skewed claims
distributions. Thus, we may use the k-folder cross-validation instead of
out-of-sample prediction to see whether the MSE and MAE types of
criterion work for right-skewed distributions based on lognormal and
gamma regression with a log link function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.3.7. Cross-validation in right-skewed outcomes - lognormal
claims** For lognormal claims, we use the data generating mechanism from
Example 5.3.5 to generate a total of 100 samples, and use the k-fold
cross validation procedure in Example 2.3.1 to select the distributional
form and mean structure. Using cross-validation, we note that both AIC
and out-of-sample MSE and MAE seem to be working for selecting the model
with the correct distribution and mean structure, even with a total of
100 samples.

Cross-validation is widely used because it retains the predictive flavor
of the out-of-sample model validation process but, due to the re-use of
the data, is more stable over random samples. In addition, Example
7.3.1. in Chapter \@ref(ChapSimulation) uses the Wisconsin Property Fund to
perform k-fold cross-validation of the gamma and Pareto models based on
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness of fit statistic. Additional information
and examples regarding re-sampling procedures including leave-one-out
cross-validation and bootstrap can also be found in Chapter
\ref@(ChapSimulation).

### Model Selection for Modified Data {#S:MS:Modified-Data}

So far, you have learned covered model selection using unmodified data.
For modified data including grouped, censored and truncated data, you
have learned parametric and nonparametric estimation of distribution
functions in Section \@ref(S:MS:ModifiedData). For model selection, the
tools from Section \@ref(S:MS:ModelSelection) can be extended to cases
of modified data.

For selection of distributions, the nonparametric tools introduced in
Section \@ref(S:MS:ToolsModelSelection) are based on estimated
parametric and nonparametric distribution functions, and thus can be
extended to modified data for which both types of estimators exist.

For graphical comparisons, the $pp$ and $qq$ plots introduced earlier
can be created for modified data by plotting the parametric estimates
from Section \@ref(S:MS:ModifiedData1) against nonparametric estimates
of the probability or distribution functions from Section
\@ref(S:MS:NonParModified). For example, the `qqPlotCensored` and
`qqtrunc` functions in `R` generate $qq$ plots respectively for censored
(left or right) and truncated data, whereas the `probPlot` function
creates both $pp$ and $qq$ plots with a larger selection of
distributions for right-censored and unmodified data. Additional
graphical tools such as cumulative hazard plots are available in the `R`
package `GofCens`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Example 5.4.1. Bodily Injury Claims.** For the Boston auto bodily
injury claims data from Example 5.1.6, we include the full dataset with
right-censoring, and use the $qq$-plot to compare the estimated
quantiles from lognormal, normal and exponential distributions with
those from the nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method. From the $qq$-plots in
Figure \@ref(fig:qqCensored), the lognormal distribution functions seems
to fit the censored data much better those based on the normal and
exponential distributions.

(ref:qqCensored) **Quantile-Quantile ($qq$) Plots for Bodily Injury Claims. The horizontal axis gives the empirical quantiles at each observation. The vertical axis gives the quantiles from the fitted distributions; lognormal quantiles are in the left panels, normal quantiles are in the right panels.**

```{r qqCensored, fig.cap='(ref:qqCensored)', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
library(GofCens)
#BIData <- read.csv("C:/Users/a1727618/OneDrive - Northern Illinois University/LDABOOK/LDA_Ed2-main/Data/DerrigResampling.csv", header =T)
UnCensored <- 1*(BIData$AmountPaid < BIData$PolicyLimit)
par(mfrow=c(2, 3))
## qq-plot for lognormal distribution
probPlot(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "lognormal", plots = "QQ")
## qq-plot for normal distribution
probPlot(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "normal", plots = "QQ")
## qq-plot for exponential distribution
probPlot(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "exponential", plots = "QQ")

```

```{r, echo=SHOW_PDF, ref.label = 'qq-plot censored', eval=FALSE}
```

</div>

In addition to graphical tools, you may use tools from Section
\@ref(S:MS:Tools:Stats) for statistical comparisons of models fitted
from modified data based on parametric and nonparametric estimates of
distribution functions. For example, the `R` package `GofCens` provides
functions calculating the three goodness of fit statistics from Section
\@ref(S:MS:Tools:Stats) for both right-censored and unmodified data. The
`R` package `truncgof`, on the other hand, provides functions for
calculating the three goodness of fit statistics for left-truncated
data.

**Example 5.4.2. Bodily Injury Claims.** For the Boston auto bodily
injury claims with right-censoring, we may use the goodness of fit
statistics to evaluate the fitted lognormal, normal and exponential
distributions from Example 5.4.1. For the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cramer-von
Mises and Anderson-Darling statistics, the lognormal distribution gives
values that are much lower than those from normal and exponential
distributions. The conclusion from the goodness of fit statistics is
consistent to that revealed by the $qq$ plots.

```{r KsCensored, fig.cap='(ref:KsCensored)', fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
library(GofCens)
#BIData <- read.csv("C:/Users/a1727618/OneDrive - Northern Illinois University/LDABOOK/LDA_Ed2-main/Data/DerrigResampling.csv", header =T)
UnCensored <- 1*(BIData$AmountPaid < BIData$PolicyLimit)
par(mfrow=c(2, 2))
## Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for lognormal distribution
KS.ln <- gofcens(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "lognormal")

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normal distribution
KS.norm <- gofcens(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "normal")

## Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for exponential distribution
KS.exp <- gofcens(BIData$AmountPaid, cens = UnCensored, distr = "exponential")


OutMat <- rbind(round(KS.ln$Test[1:3], digits = 3), round(KS.norm$Test[1:3], digits = 3),
                round(KS.exp$Test[1:3], digits = 3) )
colnames(OutMat) <- c("Kolmogorov-Smirnov", "Cramer-von Mises", "Anderson-Darling")
row.names(OutMat) <- c("Lognormal", "Normal", "Exponential")

Other than selecting the distributional form, model comparison measures
such as the likelihood ratio test and information criterion including
the AIC from Section \@ref(S:MS:Tools:Stats:Likelihood) can be obtained
for models fitted based on likelihood criteria based on the likelihood
functions introduced earlier for modified data. For modified data, the
`survreg` and `flexsurvreg` functions in `R` fit parametric regression
models on censored and/or truncated outcomes based on maximum likelihood
estimation which allows use of likelihood ratio tests and information
criterion such as AIC for in-sample model comparisons. For censored and
truncated data, the functions also provide output of residuals that
allow calculation of model validation statistics such as the MSE and MAE
for the iterative model selection procedure introduced in Section
\@ref(S:MS:Iterative:Selection).
