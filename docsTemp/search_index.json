The online version contains many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning. A subset of the book is available for offline reading in pdf and EPUB formats. The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience. What will success look like? The online text will be freely available to a worldwide audience. The online version will contain many interactive objects (quizzes, computer demonstrations, interactive graphs, video, and the like) to promote deeper learning. Moreover, a subset of the book will be available in pdf format for low-cost printing. The online text will be available in multiple languages to promote access to a worldwide audience. How will the text be used? This book will be useful in actuarial curricula worldwide. It will cover the loss data learning objectives of the major actuarial organizations. Thus, it will be suitable for classroom use at universities as well as for use by independent learners seeking to pass professional actuarial examinations. Moreover, the text will also be useful for the continuing professional development of actuaries and other professionals in insurance and related financial risk management industries. Why is this good for the profession? An online text is a type of open educational resource (OER). One important benefit of an OER is that it equalizes access to knowledge, thus permitting a broader community to learn about the actuarial profession. Moreover, it has the capacity to engage viewers through active learning that deepens the learning process, producing analysts more capable of solid actuarial work. Why is this good for students and teachers and others involved in the learning process? Cost is often cited as an important factor for students and teachers in textbook selection (see a recent post on the $400 textbook). Students will also appreciate the ability to “carry the book around” on their mobile devices. Why loss data analytics? The intent is that this type of resource will eventually permeate throughout the actuarial curriculum. Given the dramatic changes in the way that actuaries treat data, loss data seems like a natural place to start. The idea behind the name loss data analytics is to integrate classical loss data models from applied probability with modern analytic tools. In particular, we recognize that big data (including social media and usage based insurance) are here to stay and that high speed computation is readily available.

For our Readers We hope that you find this book worthwhile and even enjoyable. For your convenience, at our Github Landing site (https://openacttexts.github.io/), you will find links to the book that you can (freely) download for offline reading, including a pdf version (for Adobe Acrobat) and an EPUB version suitable for mobile devices. Data for running our examples are available at the same site. In developing this book, we are emphasizing the online version that has lots of great features such as a glossary, code and solutions to examples that you can be revealed interactively. For example, you will find that the statistical code is hidden and can only be seen by clicking on terms such as R Code for Frequency Table Insample &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Insample.csv&quot;, header = T, na.strings = c(&quot;.&quot;), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) Insample2010 &lt;- subset(Insample, Year == 2010) table(Insample2010$Freq) We hide the code because we don’t want to insist that you use the R statistical software (although we like it). Still, we encourage you to try some statistical code as you read the book – we have opted to make it easy to learn R as you go. We have set up a separate R Code for Loss Data Analytics site to explain more of the details of the code. Like any book, we have a set of notations and conventions. It will probably save you time if you regularly visit our Appendix Chapter 5 to get used to ours. Freely available, interactive textbooks represent a new venture in actuarial education and we need your input. Although a lot of effort has gone into the development, we expect hiccoughs. Please let your instructor know about opportunities for improvement, write us through our project site, or contact chapter contributors directly with suggested improvements.

"],["CAppA.html", "Chapter 1 Appendix A: Review of Statistical Inference 1.1 Basic Concepts 1.2 Point Estimation and Properties 1.3 Interval Estimation 1.4 Hypothesis Testing", " Chapter 1 Appendix A: Review of Statistical Inference Chapter Preview. The appendix gives an overview of concepts and methods related to statistical inference on the population of interest, using a random sample of observations from the population. In the appendix, Section 1.1 introduces the basic concepts related to the population and the sample used for making the inference. Section 1.2 presents the commonly used methods for point estimation of population characteristics. Section 1.3 demonstrates interval estimation that takes into consideration the uncertainty in the estimation, due to use of a random sample from the population. Section 1.4 introduces the concept of hypothesis testing for the purpose of variable and model selection. 1.1 Basic Concepts In this section, you learn the following concepts related to statistical inference. Random sampling from a population that can be summarized using a list of items or individuals within the population Sampling distributions that characterize the distributions of possible outcomes for a statistic calculated from a random sample The central limit theorem that guides the distribution of the mean of a random sample from the population Statistical inference is the process of making conclusions on the characteristics of a large set of items/individuals (i.e., the population), using a representative set of data (e.g., a random sample) from a list of items or individuals from the population that can be sampled. While the process has a broad spectrum of applications in various areas including science, engineering, health, social, and economic fields, statistical inference is important to insurance companies that use data from their existing policy holders in order to make inference on the characteristics (e.g., risk profiles) of a specific segment of target customers (i.e., the population) whom the insurance companies do not directly observe. Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. Assume there are 1,377 individual claims from the 2010 experience. Summary statistics are in Table 1.1 and a visual summary is in Figure 1.1. Table 1.1: Wisconsin Property Fund Summary Statistics Minimum First Quartile Median Mean Third Quartile Maximum Standard Deviation Claim 1 789 2,250 26,623 6,171 12,922,218 368,030 Logarithmic Claims 0 6.67 7.719 7.804 8.728 16.374 1.683 Figure 1.1: Distribution of Claims for Wisconsin Property Fund Using the 2010 claim experience (the sample), the Wisconsin Property Fund may be interested in assessing the severity of all claims that could potentially occur, such as 2010, 2011, and so forth (the population). This process is important in the contexts of ratemaking or claim predictive modeling. In order for such inference to be valid, we need to assume that the set of 2010 claims is a random sample that is representative of the population, the sampling distribution of the average claim amount can be estimated, so that we can quantify the bias and uncertainty in the estimation due to use of a finite sample. Show R Code Empirical Example Using the Wisconsin Property Fund library(doBy) ClaimLev &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/CLAIMLEVEL.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) ClaimLevBC10 &lt;- subset(ClaimLev, Year == 2010) ClaimLevBC10$LogClaim &lt;- log(ClaimLevBC10$Claim) t1 &lt;- as.numeric(doBy::summaryBy(Claim ~ 1, data = ClaimLevBC10, FUN = function(x) { c(ma = min(x), p25 = quantile(x, prob = 0.25), m1 = median(x), m = mean(x), p75 = quantile(x, prob = 0.75), mb = max(x), sd = sd(x)) })) t1 &lt;- roundCom(t1, digits = 0) t2 &lt;- as.numeric(doBy::summaryBy(LogClaim ~ 1, data = ClaimLevBC10, FUN = function(x) { c(ma = min(x), p25 = quantile(x, prob = 0.25), m1 = median(x), m = mean(x), p75 = quantile(x, prob = 0.75), mb = max(x), sd = sd(x)) })) t2 &lt;- round(t2, digits = 3) tableout &lt;- rbind(t1, t2) colnames(tableout) &lt;- c(&quot;Minimum&quot;, &quot;First Quartile&quot;, &quot;Median&quot;, &quot;Mean&quot;, &quot;Third Quartile&quot;, &quot;Maximum&quot;, &quot;Standard Deviation&quot;) rownames(tableout) &lt;- c(&quot;Claim&quot;, &quot;Logarithmic Claims&quot;) TableGen1(TableData = tableout, TextTitle = &quot;Wisconsin Property Fund Summary Statistics&quot;, Align = &quot;c&quot;, Digits = 3, ColumnSpec = 1:7, ColWidth = ColWidth7) ClaimLev &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/CLAIMLEVEL.csv&quot;, header = TRUE) ClaimLevBC10 &lt;- subset(ClaimLev, Year == 2010) # cat(&#39;Sample size: &#39;, nrow(ClaimLevBC10), &#39;\\n&#39;) par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) hist(ClaimLevBC10$Claim, main = &quot;&quot;, xlab = &quot;Claims&quot;) hist(log(ClaimLevBC10$Claim), main = &quot;&quot;, xlab = &quot;Logarithmic Claims&quot;) 1.1.1 Random Sampling In statistics, a sampling error occurs when the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is drawn, is not an adequate approximation of the population of interest. A sample must be a representative subset of a population, or universe, of interest. If the sample is not representative, taking a larger sample does not eliminate bias, as the same mistake is repeated over again and again. Thus, we introduce the concept for random sampling that gives rise to a simple random sample that is representative of the population. We assume that the random variable \\(X\\) represents a draw from a population with a distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\) with mean \\(\\mathrm{E}[X]=\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\mathrm{Var}[X]=\\mathrm{E}[(X-\\mu)^2]\\), where \\(E(\\cdot)\\) denotes the expectation of a random variable. In random sampling, we make a total of \\(n\\) such draws represented by \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), each unrelated to one another (i.e., statistically independent). We refer to \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) as a random sample (with replacement) from \\(F(\\cdot)\\), taking either a parametric or nonparametric form. Alternatively, we may say that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) are identically and independently distributed (iid) with distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\). 1.1.2 Sampling Distribution Using the random sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), we are interested in making a conclusion on a specific attribute of the population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). For example, we may be interested in making an inference on the population mean, denoted \\(\\mu\\). It is natural to think of the sample mean, \\(\\bar{X}=\\sum_{i=1}^nX_i\\), as an estimate of the population mean \\(\\mu\\). We call the sample mean as a statistic calculated from the random sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\). Other commonly used summary statistics include sample standard deviation and sample quantiles. When using a statistic (e.g., the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\)) to make statistical inference on the population attribute (e.g., population mean \\(\\mu\\)), the quality of inference is determined by the bias and uncertainty in the estimation, owing to the use of a sample in place of the population. Hence, it is important to study the distribution of a statistic that quantifies the bias and variability of the statistic. In particular, the distribution of the sample mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\) (or any other statistic), is called the sampling distribution. The sampling distribution depends on the sampling process, the statistic, the sample size \\(n\\) and the population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). The central limit theorem gives the large-sample (sampling) distribution of the sample mean under certain conditions. 1.1.3 Central Limit Theorem In statistics, there are variations of the central limit theorem (CLT) ensuring that, under certain conditions, the sample mean will approach the population mean with its sampling distribution approaching the normal distribution as the sample size goes to infinity. We give the Lindeberg–Levy CLT that establishes the asymptotic sampling distribution of the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) calculated using a random sample from a universe population having a distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Lindeberg–Levy CLT. Let \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) be a random sample from a population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\) with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2&lt;\\infty\\). The difference between the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\mu\\), when multiplied by \\(\\sqrt{n}\\), converges in distribution to a normal distribution as the sample size goes to infinity. That is, \\[ \\sqrt{n}(\\bar{X}-\\mu)\\rightarrow^{d}N(0,\\sigma). \\] Note that the CLT does not require a parametric form for \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Based on the CLT, we may perform statistical inference on the population mean (we infer, not deduce). The types of inference we may perform include estimation of the population, hypothesis testing on whether a null statement is true, and prediction of future samples from the population. 1.2 Point Estimation and Properties In this section, you learn how to estimate population parameters using method of moments estimation estimate population parameters based on maximum likelihood estimation The population distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\) can usually be characterized by a limited (finite) number of terms called parameters, in which case we refer to the distribution as a parametric distribution. In contrast, in nonparametric analysis, the attributes of the sampling distribution are not limited to a small number of parameters. For obtaining the population characteristics, there are different attributes related to the population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Such measures include the mean, median, percentiles (i.e., 95th percentile), and standard deviation. Because these summary measures do not depend on a specific parametric reference, they are nonparametric summary measures. In parametric analysis, on the other hand, we may assume specific families of distributions with specific parameters. For example, people usually think of logarithm of claim amounts to be normally distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). That is, we assume that the claims have a lognormal distribution with parameters \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). Alternatively, insurance companies commonly assume that claim severity follows a gamma distribution with a shape parameter \\(\\alpha\\) and a scale parameter \\(\\theta\\). Here, the normal, lognormal, and gamma distributions are examples of parametric distributions. In the above examples, the quantities of \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\alpha\\), and \\(\\theta\\) are known as parameters. For a given parametric distribution family, the distribution is uniquely determined by the values of the parameters. One often uses \\(\\theta\\) to denote a summary attribute of the population. In parametric models, \\(\\theta\\) can be a parameter or a function of parameters from a distribution such as the normal mean and variance parameters. In nonparametric analysis, it can take a form of a nonparametric summary such as the population mean or standard deviation. Let \\(\\hat{\\theta} =\\hat{\\theta}(X_1, \\ldots, X_n)\\) be a function of the sample that provides a proxy, or an estimate, of \\(\\theta\\). It is referred to as a statistic, a function of the sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\). Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. The sample mean 7.804 and the sample standard deviation 1.683 can be either deemed as nonparametric estimates of the population mean and standard deviation, or as parametric estimates of \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) of the normal distribution concerning the logarithmic claims. Using results from the lognormal distribution, we may estimate the expected claim, the lognormal mean, as 10,106.8 ( \\(=\\exp(7.804+1.683^2/2)\\) ). For the Wisconsin Property Fund data, we may denote \\(\\hat{\\mu} =7.804\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma} = 1.683\\), with the hat notation denoting an estimate of the parameter based on the sample. In particular, such an estimate is referred to as a point estimate, a single approximation of the corresponding parameter. For point estimation, we introduce the two commonly used methods called the method of moments estimation and maximum likelihood estimation. 1.2.1 Method of Moments Estimation Before defining the method of moments estimation, we define the the concept of moments. Moments are population attributes that characterize the distribution function \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Given a random draw \\(X\\) from \\(F(\\cdot)\\), the expectation \\(\\mu_k=\\mathrm{E}[X^k]\\) is called the \\(k\\)th moment of \\(X\\), \\(k=1,2,3,\\ldots\\) For example, the population mean \\(\\mu\\) is the first moment. Furthermore, the expectation \\(\\mathrm{E}[(X-\\mu)^k]\\) is called a \\(k\\)th central moment. Thus, the variance is the second central moment. Using the random sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\), we may construct the corresponding sample moment, \\(\\hat{\\mu}_k=(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^k\\), for estimating the population attribute \\(\\mu_k\\). For example, we have used the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) as an estimator for the population mean \\(\\mu\\). Similarly, the second central moment can be estimated as \\((1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar{X})^2\\). Without assuming a parametric form for \\(F(\\cdot)\\), the sample moments constitute nonparametric estimates of the corresponding population attributes. Such an estimator based on matching of the corresponding sample and population moments is called a method of moments estimator (mme). While the mme works naturally in a nonparametric model, it can be used to estimate parameters when a specific parametric family of distribution is assumed for \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Denote by \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=(\\theta_1,\\cdots,\\theta_m)\\) the vector of parameters corresponding to a parametric distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). Given a distribution family, we commonly know the relationships between the parameters and the moments. In particular, we know the specific forms of the functions \\(h_1(\\cdot),h_2(\\cdot),\\cdots,h_m(\\cdot)\\) such that \\(\\mu_1=h_1(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}),\\,\\mu_2=h_2(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}),\\,\\cdots,\\,\\mu_m=h_m(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\). Given the mme \\(\\hat{\\mu}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{\\mu}_m\\) from the random sample, the mme of the parameters \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{\\theta}_m\\) can be obtained by solving the equations of \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\hat{\\mu}_1&amp;=h_1(\\hat{\\theta}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{\\theta}_m) \\\\ \\hat{\\mu}_2&amp;=h_2(\\hat{\\theta}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{\\theta}_m) \\\\ \\vdots\\ \\ \\ &amp; \\ \\ \\vdots \\\\ \\hat{\\mu}_m &amp;=h_m(\\hat{\\theta}_1,\\cdots,\\hat{\\theta}_m). \\end{array} \\] Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. Assume that the claims follow a lognormal distribution, so that logarithmic claims follow a normal distribution. Specifically, assume \\(\\log(X)\\) has a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), denoted as \\(\\log(X) \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). It is straightforward that the mme \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}=\\sqrt{(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar{X})^2}\\). For the Wisconsin Property Fund example, the method of moments estimates are \\(\\hat{\\mu} =7.804\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma} = 1.683\\). 1.2.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimation When \\(F(\\cdot)\\) takes a parametric form, the maximum likelihood method is widely used for estimating the population parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\). Maximum likelihood estimation is based on the likelihood function, a function of the parameters given the observed sample. Denote by \\(f(x_i|\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\) the probability function of \\(X_i\\) evaluated at \\(X_i=x_i\\) \\((i=1,2,\\cdots,n)\\); it is the probability mass function in the case of a discrete \\(X\\) and the probability density function in the case of a continuous \\(X\\). Assuming independence, the likelihood function of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) associated with the observation \\((X_1,X_2,\\cdots,X_n)=(x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n)=\\mathbf{x}\\) can be written as \\[ L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{i=1}^nf(x_i|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}), \\] with the corresponding log-likelihood function given by \\[ l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})=\\log(L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x}))=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\log f(x_i|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}). \\] The maximum likelihood estimator (mle) of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) is the set of values of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) that maximize the likelihood function (log-likelihood function), given the observed sample. That is, the mle \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\) can be written as \\[ \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}={\\mbox{argmax}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\in\\Theta}l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x}), \\] where \\(\\Theta\\) is the parameter space of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), and \\({\\mbox{argmax}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\in\\Theta}l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})\\) is defined as the value of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) at which the function \\(l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})\\) reaches its maximum. Given the analytical form of the likelihood function, the mle can be obtained by taking the first derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), and setting the values of the partial derivatives to zero. That is, the mle are the solutions of the equations of \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{\\partial l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\hat{\\theta}_1}&amp;=0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\hat{\\theta}_2}&amp;=0 \\\\ \\cdots \\\\ \\frac{\\partial l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\hat{\\theta}_m}&amp;=0, \\end{array} \\] provided that the second partial derivatives are negative. For parametric models, the mle of the parameters can be obtained either analytically (e.g., in the case of normal distributions and linear estimators), or numerically through iterative algorithms such as the Newton-Raphson method and its adaptive versions (e.g., in the case of generalized linear models with a non-normal response variable). Normal distribution. Assume \\((X_1,X_2,\\cdots,X_n)\\) to be a random sample from the normal distribution \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\). With an observed sample \\((X_1,X_2,\\cdots,X_n)=(x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n)\\), we can write the likelihood function of \\(\\mu,\\sigma^2\\) as \\[L(\\mu,\\sigma^2)=\\prod_{i=1}^n\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}e^{-\\frac{\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\right],\\] with the corresponding log-likelihood function given by \\[l(\\mu,\\sigma^2)=-\\frac{n}{2}[\\log(2\\pi)+\\log(\\sigma^2)]-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(x_i-\\mu\\right)^2.\\] By solving \\[ \\frac{\\partial l(\\hat{\\mu},\\sigma^2)}{\\partial \\hat{\\mu}}=0, \\] we obtain \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{x}=(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i\\). It is straightforward to verify that \\(\\frac{\\partial l^2(\\hat{\\mu},\\sigma^2)}{\\partial \\hat{\\mu}^2}\\left|_{\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{x}}\\right.&lt;0\\). Since this works for arbitrary \\(x\\), \\(\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{X}\\) is the mle of \\(\\mu\\). Similarly, by solving \\[ \\frac{\\partial l(\\mu,\\hat{\\sigma}^2)}{\\partial \\hat{\\sigma}^2}=0, \\] we obtain \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\mu)^2\\). Further replacing \\(\\mu\\) by \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\), we derive the mle of \\(\\sigma^2\\) as \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2=(1/n)\\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\\bar{X})^2\\). Hence, the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) are both the mme and MLEMaximum likelihood estimate for the mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), under a normal population distribution \\(F(\\cdot)\\). More details regarding the properties of the likelihood function are given in Appendix Section ??. 1.3 Interval Estimation In this section, you learn how to derive the exact sampling distribution of the mle of the normal mean obtain the large-sample approximation of the sampling distribution using the large sample properties of the mle construct a confidence interval of a parameter based on the large sample properties of the mle Now that we have introduced the mme and mle, we may perform the first type of statistical inference, interval estimation that quantifies the uncertainty resulting from the use of a finite sample. By deriving the sampling distribution of mle, we can estimate an interval (a confidence interval) for the parameter. Under the frequentist approach (e.g., that based on maximum likelihood estimation), the confidence intervals generated from the same random sampling frame will cover the true value the majority of times (e.g., 95% of the times), if we repeat the sampling process and re-calculate the interval over and over again. Such a process requires the derivation of the sampling distribution for the mle. 1.3.1 Exact Distribution for Normal Sample Mean Due to the additivity property of the normal distribution (i.e., a sum of normal random variables that follows a multivariate normal distribution still follows a normal distribution) and that the normal distribution belongs to the location–scale family (i.e., a location and/or scale transformation of a normal random variable has a normal distribution), the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) of a random sample from a normal \\(F(\\cdot)\\) has a normal sampling distribution for any finite \\(n\\). Given \\(X_i\\sim^{iid} N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\), \\(i=1,\\dots,n\\), the mle of \\(\\mu\\) has an exact distribution \\[\\bar{X}\\sim N\\left(\\mu,\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right).\\] Hence, the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\mu\\). In addition, the uncertainty in the estimation can be quantified by its variance \\(\\sigma^2/n\\), that decreases with the sample size \\(n\\). When the sample size goes to infinity, the sample mean will approach a single mass at the true value. 1.3.2 Large-sample Properties of MLE For the mle of the mean parameter and any other parameters of other parametric distribution families, however, we usually cannot derive an exact sampling distribution for finite samples. Fortunately, when the sample size is sufficiently large, mles can be approximated by a normal distribution. Due to the general maximum likelihood theory, the mle has some nice large-sample properties. The mle \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) of a parameter \\(\\theta\\), is a consistent estimator. That is, \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) converges in probability to the true value \\(\\theta\\), as the sample size \\(n\\) goes to infinity. The mle has the asymptotic normality property, meaning that the estimator will converge in distribution to a normal distribution centered around the true value, when the sample size goes to infinity. Namely, \\[\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta)\\rightarrow_d N\\left(0,\\,V\\right),\\quad \\mbox{as}\\quad n\\rightarrow \\infty,\\] where \\(V\\) is the inverse of the Fisher Information. Hence, the mle \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) approximately follows a normal distribution with mean \\(\\theta\\) and variance \\(V/n\\), when the sample size is large. The mle is efficient, meaning that it has the smallest asymptotic variance \\(V\\), commonly referred to as the Cramer–Rao lower bound. In particular, the Cramer–Rao lower bound is the inverse of the Fisher information defined as \\(\\mathcal{I}(\\theta)=-\\mathrm{E}(\\partial^2\\log f(X;\\theta)/\\partial \\theta^2)\\). Hence, \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})\\) can be estimated based on the observed Fisher information that can be written as \\(-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\partial^2\\log f(X_i;\\theta)/\\partial \\theta^2\\). For many parametric distributions, the Fisher information may be derived analytically for the mle of parameters. For more sophisticated parametric models, the Fisher information can be evaluated numerically using numerical integration for continuous distributions, or numerical summation for discrete distributions. More details regarding maximum likelihood estimation are given in Appendix Section ??. 1.3.3 Confidence Interval Given that the mle \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) has either an exact or an approximate normal distribution with mean \\(\\theta\\) and variance \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})\\), we may take the square root of the variance and plug-in the estimate to define \\(se(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\theta})}\\). A standard error is an estimated standard deviation that quantifies the uncertainty in the estimation resulting from the use of a finite sample. Under some regularity conditions governing the population distribution, we may establish that the statistic \\[ \\frac{\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta}{se(\\hat{\\theta})} \\] converges in distribution to a Student-\\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom (a parameter of the distribution) \\({n-p}\\), where \\(p\\) is the number of parameters in the model other than the variance. For example, for the normal distribution case, we have \\(p=1\\) for the parameter \\(\\mu\\); for a linear regression model with an independent variable, we have \\(p=2\\) for the parameters of the intercept and the independent variable. Denote by \\(t_{n-p}(1-\\alpha/2)\\) the \\(100\\times(1-\\alpha/2)\\)-th percentile of the Student-\\(t\\) distribution that satisfies \\(\\Pr\\left[t&lt; t_{n-p}\\left(1-{\\alpha}/{2}\\right) \\right]= 1-{\\alpha}/{2}\\). We have, \\[ \\Pr\\left[-t_{n-p}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)&lt;\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta}{se(\\hat{\\theta})}&lt; t_{n-p}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\right]= 1-{\\alpha}, \\] from which we can derive a confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\). From the above equation we can derive a pair of statistics, \\(\\hat{\\theta}_1\\) and \\(\\hat{\\theta}_2\\), that provide an interval of the form \\([\\hat{\\theta}_1, \\hat{\\theta}_2]\\). This interval is a \\(1-\\alpha\\) confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\) such that \\(\\Pr\\left(\\hat{\\theta}_1 \\le \\theta \\le \\hat{\\theta}_2\\right) = 1-\\alpha,\\) where the probability \\(1-\\alpha\\) is referred to as the confidence level. Note that the above confidence interval is not valid for small samples, except for the case of the normal mean. Normal distribution. For the normal population mean \\(\\mu\\), the mle has an exact sampling distribution \\(\\bar{X}\\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma/\\sqrt{n})\\), in which we can estimate \\(se(\\hat{\\theta})\\) by \\(\\hat{\\sigma}/\\sqrt{n}\\). Based on the Cochran’s theorem, the resulting statistic has an exact Student-\\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom \\(n-1\\). Hence, we can derive the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval as \\[ \\hat{\\mu}_1 = \\hat{\\mu} - t_{n-1}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\frac{ \\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}} \\] and \\[ \\hat{\\mu}_2 = \\hat{\\mu} + t_{n-1}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\frac{ \\hat{\\sigma}}{\\sqrt{n}}. \\] When \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), \\(t_{n-1}(1-\\alpha/2) \\approx 1.96\\) for large values of \\(n\\). Based on the Cochran’s theorem, the confidence interval is valid regardless of the sample size. Show Wisconsin Property Fund Example - Continued Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. For the lognormal claim model, (7.715235, 7.893208) is a 95% confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\). More details regarding interval estimation based the mle of other parameters and distribution families are given in Appendix Chapter 3. 1.4 Hypothesis Testing In this section, you learn how to understand the basic concepts in hypothesis testing including the level of significance and the power of a test perform hypothesis testing such as a Student-\\(t\\) test based on the properties of the mle construct a likelihood ratio test for a single parameter or multiple parameters from the same statistical model use information criteria such as the Akaike’s information criterion or the Bayesian information criterion to perform model selection For the parameter(s) \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) from a parametric distribution, an alternative type of statistical inference is called hypothesis testing that verifies whether a hypothesis regarding the parameter(s) is true, under a given probability called the level of significance \\(\\alpha\\) (e.g., 5%). In hypothesis testing, we reject the null hypothesis, a restrictive statement concerning the parameter(s), if the probability of observing a random sample as extremal as the observed one is smaller than \\(\\alpha\\), if the null hypothesis were true. 1.4.1 Basic Concepts In a statistical test, we are usually interested in testing whether a statement regarding some parameter(s), a null hypothesis (denoted \\(H_0\\)), is true given the observed data. The null hypothesis can take a general form \\(H_0:\\theta\\in\\Theta_0\\), where \\(\\Theta_0\\) is a subset of the parameter space \\(\\Theta\\) of \\(\\theta\\) that may contain multiple parameters. For the case with a single parameter \\(\\theta\\), the null hypothesis usually takes either the form \\(H_0:\\theta=\\theta_0\\) or \\(H_0:\\theta\\leq\\theta_0\\). The opposite of the null hypothesis is called the alternative hypothesis that can be written as \\(H_a:\\theta\\neq\\theta_0\\) or \\(H_a:\\theta&gt;\\theta_0\\). The statistical test on \\(H_0:\\theta=\\theta_0\\) is called a two-sided as the alternative hypothesis contains two inequalities of \\(H_a:\\theta&lt;\\theta_0\\) or \\(\\theta&gt;\\theta_0\\). In contrast, the statistical test on either \\(H_0:\\theta\\leq\\theta_0\\) or \\(H_0:\\theta\\geq\\theta_0\\) is called a one-sided test. A statistical test is usually constructed based on a statistic \\(T\\) and its exact or large-sample distribution. The test typically rejects a two-sided test when either \\(T &gt; c_1\\) or \\(T &lt; c_2\\), where the two constants \\(c_1\\) and \\(c_2\\) are obtained based on the sampling distribution of \\(T\\) at a probability level \\(\\alpha\\) called the level of significance. In particular, the level of significance \\(\\alpha\\) satisfies \\[ \\alpha=\\Pr(\\mbox{reject }H_0|H_0\\mbox{ is true}), \\] meaning that if the null hypothesis were true, we would reject the null hypothesis only 5% of the times, if we repeat the sampling process and perform the test over and over again. Thus, the level of significance is the probability of making a type I error (error of the first kind), the error of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis. For this reason, the level of significance \\(\\alpha\\) is also referred to as the type I error rate. Another type of error we may make in hypothesis testing is the type II error (error of the second kind), the error of incorrectly accepting a false null hypothesis. Similarly, we can define the type II error rate as the probability of not rejecting (accepting) a null hypothesis given that it is not true. That is, the type II error rate is given by \\[ \\Pr(\\mbox{accept }H_0|H_0\\mbox{ is false}). \\] Another important quantity concerning the quality of the statistical test is called the power of the test \\(\\beta\\), defined as the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis. The mathematical definition of the power is \\[ \\beta=\\Pr(\\mbox{reject }H_0|H_0\\mbox{ is false}). \\] Note that the power of the test is typically calculated based on a specific alternative value of \\(\\theta=\\theta_a\\), given a specific sampling distribution and a given sample size. In real experimental studies, people usually calculate the required sample size in order to choose a sample size that will ensure a large chance of obtaining a statistically significant test (i.e., with a prespecified statistical power such as 85%). 1.4.2 Student-t test based on mle Based on the results from Section 1.3.1, we can define a Student-\\(t\\) test for testing \\(H_0:\\theta=\\theta_0\\). In particular, we define the test statistic as \\[ t\\text{-stat}=\\frac{\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta_0}{se(\\hat{\\theta})}, \\] which has a large-sample distribution of a student-\\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom \\({n-p}\\), when the null hypothesis is true (i.e., when \\(\\theta=\\theta_0\\)). For a given level of significance \\(\\alpha\\), say 5%, we reject the null hypothesis if the event \\(t\\text{-stat}&lt;-t_{n-p}\\left(1-{\\alpha}/{2}\\right)\\) or \\(t\\text{-stat}&gt; t_{n-p}\\left(1-{\\alpha}/{2}\\right)\\) occurs (the rejection region). Under the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), we have \\[ \\Pr\\left[t\\text{-stat}&lt;-t_{n-p}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\right]=\\Pr\\left[t\\text{-stat}&gt; t_{n-p}\\left(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right) \\right]= \\frac{\\alpha}{2}. \\] In addition to the concept of rejection region, we may reject the test based on the \\(p\\)-value defined as \\(2\\Pr(T&gt;|t\\text{-stat}|)\\) for the aforementioned two-sided test, where the random variable \\(T\\sim T_{n-p}\\). We reject the null hypothesis if \\(p\\)-value is smaller than and equal to \\(\\alpha\\). For a given sample, a \\(p\\)-value is defined to be the smallest significance level for which the null hypothesis would be rejected. Similarly, we can construct a one-sided test for the null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\theta\\leq\\theta_0\\) (or \\(H_0:\\theta\\geq\\theta_0\\)). Using the same test statistic, we reject the null hypothesis when \\(t\\text{-stat}&gt; t_{n-p}\\left(1-{\\alpha}\\right)\\) (or \\(t\\text{-stat}&lt;- t_{n-p}\\left(1-{\\alpha}\\right)\\) for the test on \\(H_0:\\theta\\geq\\theta_0\\)). The corresponding \\(p\\)-value is defined as \\(\\Pr(T&gt;|t\\text{-stat}|)\\) (or \\(\\Pr(T&lt;|t\\text{-stat}|)\\) for the test on \\(H_0:\\theta\\geq\\theta_0\\)). Note that the test is not valid for small samples, except for the case of the test on the normal mean. One-sample \\(t\\) Test for Normal Mean. For the test on the normal mean of the form \\(H_0:\\mu=\\mu_0\\), \\(H_0:\\mu\\leq\\mu_0\\) or \\(H_0:\\mu\\geq\\mu_0\\), we can define the test statistic as \\[ t\\text{-stat}=\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu_0}{{\\hat{\\sigma}}/{\\sqrt{n}}}, \\] for which we have an exact sampling distribution \\(t\\text{-stat}\\sim T_{n-1}\\) from the Cochran’s theorem, with \\(T_{n-1}\\) denoting a Student-\\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom \\(n-1\\). According to the Cochran’s theorem, the test is valid for both small and large samples. Show Wisconsin Property Fund Example - Continued Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. Assume that mean logarithmic claims have historically been approximately by \\(\\mu_0 = \\log(5000)= 8.517\\). We might want to use the 2010 data to assess whether the mean of the distribution has changed (a two-sided test), or whether it has increased (a one-sided test). Given the actual 2010 average \\(\\hat{\\mu} =7.804\\), we may use the one-sample \\(t\\) test to assess whether this is a significant departure from \\(\\mu_0 = 8.517\\) (i.e., in testing \\(H_0:\\mu=8.517\\)). The test statistic \\(t\\text{-stat}=(8.517-7.804)/(1.683/\\sqrt{1377}) = 15.72&gt;t_{1376}\\left(0.975\\right)\\). Hence, we reject the two-sided test at \\(\\alpha=5\\%\\). Similarly, we will reject the one-sided test at \\(\\alpha=5\\%\\). Example – Wisconsin Property Fund. For numerical stability and extensions to regression applications, statistical packages often work with transformed versions of parameters. Table 1.2 provides estimates based on the R package VGAM (the function). More details on the mle of other distribution families are given in Appendix Chapter 3.

In this section, we define an alternative test called the likelihood ratio test (LRT). The LRT may be used to test multiple parameters from the same statistical model. Given the likelihood function \\(L(\\theta|\\mathbf{x})\\) and \\(\\Theta_0 \\subset \\Theta\\), the likelihood ratio test statistic for testing \\(H_0:\\theta\\in\\Theta_0\\) against \\(H_a:\\theta\\notin\\Theta_0\\) is given by \\[ L=\\frac{\\sup_{\\theta\\in\\Theta_0}L(\\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\sup_{\\theta\\in\\Theta}L(\\theta|\\mathbf{x})}, \\] and that for testing \\(H_0:\\theta=\\theta_0\\) versus \\(H_a:\\theta\\neq\\theta_0\\) is \\[ L=\\frac{L(\\theta_0|\\mathbf{x})}{\\sup_{\\theta\\in\\Theta}L(\\theta|\\mathbf{x})}. \\] The LRT rejects the null hypothesis when \\(L &lt; c\\), with the threshold depending on the level of significance \\(\\alpha\\), the sample size \\(n\\), and the number of parameters in \\(\\theta\\). Based on the Neyman–Pearson Lemma, the LRT is the uniformly most powerful test for testing \\(H_0:\\theta=\\theta_0\\) versus \\(H_a:\\theta=\\theta_a\\). That is, it provides the largest power \\(\\beta\\) for a given \\(\\alpha\\) and a given alternative value \\(\\theta_a\\). Based on the Wilks’s Theorem, the likelihood ratio test statistic \\(-2\\log(L)\\) converges in distribution to a Chi-square distribution with the degree of freedom being the difference between the dimensionality of the parameter spaces \\(\\Theta\\) and \\(\\Theta_0\\), when the sample size goes to infinity and when the null model is nested within the alternative model. That is, when the null model is a special case of the alternative model containing a restricted sample space, we may approximate \\(c\\) by \\(\\chi^2_{p_1 - p_2}(1-\\alpha)\\), the \\(100\\times(1-\\alpha)\\) th percentile of the Chi-square distribution, with \\(p_1-p_2\\) being the degrees of freedom, and \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\) being the numbers of parameters in the alternative and null models, respectively. Note that the LRT is also a large-sample test that will not be valid for small samples. 1.4.4 Information Criteria In real-life applications, the LRT has been commonly used for comparing two nested models. The LRT approach as a model selection tool, however, has two major drawbacks: 1) It typically requires the null model to be nested within the alternative model; 2) models selected from the LRT tends to provide in-sample over-fitting, leading to poor out-of-sample prediction. In order to overcome these issues, model selection based on information criteria, applicable to non-nested models while taking into consideration the model complexity, is more widely used for model selection. Here, we introduce the two most widely used criteria, the Akaike’s information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion. In particular, the Akaike’s information criterion (\\(AIC\\)) is defined as \\[ AIC = -2\\log L(\\hat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}) + 2p, \\] where \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}\\) denotes the mle of \\({\\boldsymbol \\theta}\\), and \\(p\\) is the number of parameters in the model. The additional term \\(2 p\\) represents a penalty for the complexity of the model. That is, with the same maximized likelihood function, the \\(AIC\\) favors model with less parameters. We note that the \\(AIC\\) does not consider the impact from the sample size \\(n\\). Alternatively, people use the Bayesian information criterion (\\(BIC\\)) that takes into consideration the sample size. The \\(BIC\\) is defined as \\[ BIC = -2\\log L(\\hat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}) + p\\,\\log(n). \\] We observe that the \\(BIC\\) generally puts a higher weight on the number of parameters. With the same maximized likelihood function, the \\(BIC\\) will suggest a more parsimonious model than the \\(AIC\\). Example – Wisconsin Property Fund.

"],["CAppB.html", "Chapter 2 Appendix B: Iterated Expectations 2.1 Conditional Distribution and Conditional Expectation 2.2 Iterated Expectations and Total Variance 2.3 Conjugate Distributions", " Chapter 2 Appendix B: Iterated Expectations This appendix introduces the laws related to iterated expectations. In particular, Section 2.1 introduces the concepts of conditional distribution and conditional expectation. Section 2.2 introduces the Law of Iterated Expectations and the Law of Total Variance. In some situations, we only observe a single outcome but can conceptualize an outcome as resulting from a two (or more) stage process. Such types of statistical models are called two-stage, or hierarchical models. Some special cases of hierarchical models include: models where the parameters of the distribution are random variables; mixture distribution, where Stage 1 represents the draw of a subpopulation and Stage 2 represents a random variable from a distribution that is determined by the subpopulation drew in Stage 1; an aggregate distribution, where Stage 1 represents the draw of the number of events and Stage 2 represents the loss amount occurred per event. In these situations, the process gives rise to a conditional distribution of a random variable (the Stage 2 outcome) given the other (the Stage 1 outcome). The Law of Iterated Expectations can be useful for obtaining the unconditional expectation or variance of a random variable in such cases. 2.1 Conditional Distribution and Conditional Expectation In this section, you learn the concepts related to the conditional distribution of a random variable given another how to define the conditional expectation and variance based on the conditional distribution function The iterated expectations are the laws regarding calculation of the expectation and variance of a random variable using a conditional distribution of the variable given another variable. Hence, we first introduce the concepts related to the conditional distribution, and the calculation of the conditional expectation and variance based on a given conditional distribution. 2.1.1 Conditional Distribution Here we introduce the concept of conditional distribution respectively for discrete and continuous random variables. 2.1.1.1 Discrete Case Suppose that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are both discrete random variables, meaning that they can take a finite or countable number of possible values with a positive probability. The joint probability (mass) function of (\\(X\\), \\(Y\\)) is defined as \\[ p(x,y) = \\Pr[X=x, Y=y] . \\] When \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent (the value of \\(X\\) does not depend on that of \\(Y\\)), we have \\[ p(x,y)=p(x)p(y), \\] with \\(p(x)=\\Pr[X=x]\\) and \\(p(y)=\\Pr[Y=y]\\) being the marginal probability functions of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively. Given the joint probability function, we may obtain the marginal probability function of \\(Y\\) as \\[ p(y)=\\sum_x p(x,y), \\] where the summation is over all possible values of \\(x\\), and the marginal probability function of \\(X\\) can be obtained in a similar manner. The conditional probability (mass) function of \\((Y|X)\\) is defined as \\[ p(y|x) =\\Pr[Y=y|X=x]= \\frac{p(x,y)}{\\Pr[X=x]}, \\] where we may obtain the conditional probability function of \\((X|Y)\\) in a similar manner. In particular, the above conditional probability represents the probability of the event \\(Y=y\\) given the event \\(X=x\\). Hence, even in cases where \\(\\Pr[X=x]=0\\), the function may be given as a particular form, in real applications. 2.1.1.2 Continuous Case For continuous random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we may define their joint probability (density) function based on the joint cumulative distribution function. The joint cumulative distribution function of (\\(X\\), \\(Y\\)) is defined as \\[ F(x,y) = \\Pr[X\\leq x, Y\\leq y]. \\] When \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, we have \\[ F(x,y)=F(x)F(y), \\] with \\(F(x)=\\Pr[X\\leq x]\\) and \\(F(y)=\\Pr[Y\\leq y]\\) being the cumulative distribution functions (cdfs) of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), respectively. The random variable \\(X\\) is referred to as a continuous random variable if its cdf is continuous on \\(x\\). When the cdf \\(F(x)\\) is continuous on \\(x\\), then we define \\(f(x)=\\partial F(x)/\\partial x\\) as the (marginal) probability density function (pdf) of \\(X\\). Similarly, if the joint cdf \\(F(x,y)\\) is continuous on both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), we define \\[ f(x,y)=\\frac{\\partial^2 F(x,y)}{\\partial x\\partial y} \\] as the joint probability density function of (\\(X\\), \\(Y\\)), in which case we refer to the random variables as jointly continuous. When \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent, we have \\[ f(x,y)=f(x)f(y). \\] Given the joint density function, we may obtain the marginal density function of \\(Y\\) as \\[ f(y)=\\int_x f(x,y)\\,dx, \\] where the integral is over all possible values of \\(x\\), and the marginal probability function of \\(X\\) can be obtained in a similar manner. Based on the joint pdfProbability density function and the marginal pdf, we define the conditional probability density function of \\((Y|X)\\) as \\[ f(y|x) = \\frac{f(x,y)}{f(x)}, \\] where we may obtain the conditional probability function of \\((X|Y)\\) in a similar manner. Here, the conditional density function is the density function of \\(y\\) given \\(X=x\\). Hence, even in cases where \\(\\Pr[X=x]=0\\) or when \\(f(x)\\) is not defined, the function may be given in a particular form in real applications. 2.1.2 Conditional Expectation and Conditional Variance Now we define the conditional expectation and variance based on the conditional distribution defined in the previous subsection. 2.1.2.1 Discrete Case For a discrete random variable \\(Y\\), its expectation is defined as \\(\\mathrm{E}[Y]=\\sum_y y\\,p(y)\\) if its value is finite, and its variance is defined as \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y]=\\mathrm{E}\\{(Y-\\mathrm{E}[Y])^2\\}=\\sum_y y^2\\,p(y)-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y]\\}^2\\) if its value is finite. For a discrete random variable \\(Y\\), the conditional expectation of the random variable \\(Y\\) given the event \\(X=x\\) is defined as \\[ \\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]=\\sum_y y\\,p(y|x), \\] where \\(X\\) does not have to be a discrete variable, as far as the conditional probability function \\(p(y|x)\\) is given. Note that the conditional expectation \\(\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\) is a fixed number. When we replace \\(x\\) with \\(X\\) on the right-hand side of the above equation, we can define the expectation of \\(Y\\) given the random variable \\(X\\) as \\[ \\mathrm{E}[Y|X]=\\sum_y y\\,p(y|X), \\] which is still a random variable, and the randomness comes from \\(X\\). In a similar manner, we can define the conditional variance of the random variable \\(Y\\) given the event \\(X=x\\) as \\[ \\mathrm{Var}[Y|X=x]=\\mathrm{E}[Y^2|X=x]-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\}^2=\\sum_y y^2\\,p(y|x)-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\}^2. \\] The variance of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\), \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y|X]\\) can be defined by replacing \\(x\\) by \\(X\\) in the above equation, and \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y|X]\\) is still a random variable and the randomness comes from \\(X\\). 2.1.2.2 Continuous Case For a continuous random variable \\(Y\\), its expectation is defined as \\(\\mathrm{E}[Y]=\\int_y y\\,f(y)dy\\) if the integral exists, and its variance is defined as \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y]=\\mathrm{E}\\{(X-\\mathrm{E}[Y])^2\\}=\\int_y y^2\\,f(y)dy-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y]\\}^2\\) if its value is finite. For jointly continuous random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the conditional expectation of the random variable \\(Y\\) given \\(X=x\\) is defined as \\[\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]=\\int_y y\\,f(y|x)dy.\\] where \\(X\\) does not have to be a continuous variable, as far as the conditional probability function \\(f(y|x)\\) is given. Similarly, the conditional expectation \\(\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\) is a fixed number. When we replace \\(x\\) with \\(X\\) on the right-hand side of the above equation, we can define the expectation of \\(Y\\) given the random variable \\(X\\) as \\[ \\mathrm{E}[Y|X]=\\int_y y\\,p(y|X)\\,dy, \\] which is still a random variable, and the randomness comes from \\(X\\). In a similar manner, we can define the conditional variance of the random variable \\(Y\\) given the event \\(X=x\\) as \\[ \\mathrm{Var}[Y|X=x]=\\mathrm{E}[Y^2|X=x]-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\}^2=\\int_y y^2\\,f(y|x)\\,dy-\\{\\mathrm{E}[Y|X=x]\\}^2. \\] The variance of \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\), \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y|X]\\) can then be defined by replacing \\(x\\) by \\(X\\) in the above equation, and similarly \\(\\mathrm{Var}[Y|X]\\) is also a random variable and the randomness comes from \\(X\\). 2.2 Iterated Expectations and Total Variance In this section, you learn the Law of Iterated Expectations for calculating the expectation of a random variable based on its conditional distribution given another random variable the Law of Total Variance for calculating the variance of a random variable based on its conditional distribution given another random variable how to calculate the expectation and variance based on an example of a two-stage model 2.2.1 Law of Iterated Expectations Consider two random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), and \\(h(X,Y)\\), a random variable depending on the function \\(h\\), \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\). Assuming all the expectations exist and are finite, the Law of Iterated Expectations states that \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{E}[h(X,Y)]= \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right \\}, \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where the first (inside) expectation is taken with respect to the random variable \\(Y\\) and the second (outside) expectation is taken with respect to \\(X\\). For the Law of Iterated Expectations, the random variables may be discrete, continuous, or a hybrid combination of the two. We use the example of discrete variables of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) to illustrate the calculation of the unconditional expectation using the Law of Iterated Expectations. For continuous random variables, we only need to replace the summation with the integral, as illustrated earlier in the appendix. Given \\(p(y|x)\\) the conditional pmfProbability mass function of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), the conditional expectation of \\(h(X,Y)\\) given the event \\(X=x\\) is defined as \\[ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X=x \\right] = \\sum_y h(x,y) p(y|x), \\] and the conditional expectation of \\(h(X,Y)\\) given \\(X\\) being a random variable can be written as \\[ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] = \\sum_y h(X,y) p(y|X). \\] The unconditional expectation of \\(h(X,Y)\\) can then be obtained by taking the expectation of \\(\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right]\\) with respect to the random variable \\(X\\). That is, we can obtain \\(\\mathrm{E}[ h(X,Y)]\\) as \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right \\} &amp;= \\sum_x \\left\\{\\sum_y h(x,y) p(y|x) \\right \\} p(x) \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_x \\sum_y h(x,y) p(y|x)p(x) \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_x \\sum_y h(x,y) p(x,y) = \\mathrm{E}[h(X,Y)] \\end{aligned}. \\] The Law of Iterated Expectations for the continuous and hybrid cases can be proved in a similar manner, by replacing the corresponding summation(s) by integral(s). 2.2.2 Law of Total Variance Assuming that all the variances exist and are finite, the Law of Total Variance states that \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Var}[h(X,Y)]= \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{Var} \\left[h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right \\} +\\mathrm{Var} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right \\}, \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] where the first (inside) expectation/variance is taken with respect to the random variable \\(Y\\) and the second (outside) expectation/variance is taken with respect to \\(X\\). Thus, the unconditional variance equals to the expectation of the conditional variance plus the variance of the conditional expectation. Show Verification of the Law of Total Variance In order to verify this rule, first note that we can calculate a conditional variance as \\[ \\mathrm{Var} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] = \\mathrm{E} [ h(X,Y)^2 | X ] -\\left\\{\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right\\}^2. \\] From this, the expectation of the conditional variance is \\[\\begin{align} \\mathrm{E}\\{\\mathrm{Var} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\} &amp;= \\mathrm{E}\\left\\{\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y)^2 | X \\right] \\right\\} - \\mathrm{E}\\left(\\left\\{\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right\\}^2\\right) \\notag \\\\ &amp;=\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y)^2\\right] - \\mathrm{E}\\left(\\left\\{\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right\\}^2\\right). \\tag{2.3} \\end{align}\\] Further, note that the conditional expectation, \\(\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right]\\), is a function of \\(X\\), denoted \\(g(X)\\). Thus, \\(g(X)\\) is a random variable with mean \\(\\mathrm{E}[h(X,Y)]\\) and variance \\[\\begin{align} \\mathrm{Var} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right \\} &amp;=\\mathrm{Var}[g(X)] \\notag \\\\ &amp;= \\mathrm{E}[g(X)^2]\\ - \\left\\{\\mathrm{E}[g(X)]\\right\\}^2 \\nonumber\\\\ &amp;= \\mathrm{E}\\left(\\left\\{\\mathrm{E} \\left[ h(X,Y) | X \\right] \\right\\}^2\\right) - \\left\\{\\mathrm{E}[h(X,Y)]\\right\\}^2. \\tag{2.4} \\end{align}\\] Thus, adding Equations (2.3) and (2.4) leads to the unconditional variance \\(\\mathrm{Var} \\left[ h(X,Y) \\right]\\). 2.2.3 Application To apply the Law of Iterated Expectations and the Law of Total Variance, we generally adopt the following procedure. Identify the random variable that is being conditioned upon, typically a stage 1 outcome (that is not observed). Conditional on the stage 1 outcome, calculate summary measures such as a mean, variance, and the like. There are several results of the step 2, one for each stage 1 outcome. Then, combine these results using the iterated expectations or total variance rules. Mixtures of Finite Populations. Suppose that the random variable \\(N_1\\) represents a realization of the number of claims in a policy year from the population of good drivers and \\(N_2\\) represents that from the population of bad drivers. For a specific driver, there is a probability \\(\\alpha\\) that (s)he is a good driver. For a specific draw \\(N\\), we have \\[ N = \\begin{cases} N_1, &amp; \\text{if (s)he is a good driver;}\\\\ N_2, &amp; \\text{otherwise}.\\\\ \\end{cases} \\] Let \\(T\\) be the indicator whether (s)he is a good driver, with \\(T=1\\) representing that the driver is a good driver with \\(\\Pr[T=1]=\\alpha\\) and \\(T=2\\) representing that the driver is a bad driver with \\(\\Pr[T=2]=1-\\alpha\\). From equation (2.1), we can obtain the expected number of claims as \\[ \\mathrm{E}[N]= \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ N | T \\right] \\right \\}= \\mathrm{E}[N_1] \\times \\alpha + \\mathrm{E}[N_2] \\times (1-\\alpha).\\] From equation (2.2), we can obtain the variance of \\(N\\) as \\[ \\mathrm{Var}[N]= \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{Var} \\left[ N | T \\right] \\right \\} +\\mathrm{Var} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ N | T \\right] \\right \\}. \\] To be more concrete, suppose that \\(N_j\\) follows a Poisson distribution with the mean \\(\\lambda_j\\), \\(j=1,2\\). Then we have \\[ \\mathrm{Var}[N|T=j]= \\mathrm{E}[N|T=j] = \\lambda_j, \\quad j = 1,2. \\] Thus, we can derive the expectation of the conditional variance as \\[ \\mathrm{E} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{Var} \\left[ N | T \\right] \\right \\} = \\alpha \\lambda_1+ (1-\\alpha) \\lambda_2 \\] and the variance of the conditional expectation as \\[ \\mathrm{Var} \\left\\{ \\mathrm{E} \\left[ N | T \\right] \\right \\} = (\\lambda_1-\\lambda_2)^2 \\alpha (1-\\alpha). \\] Note that the later is the variance for a Bernoulli with outcomes \\(\\lambda_1\\) and \\(\\lambda_2\\), and the binomial probability \\(\\alpha\\). Based on the Law of Total Variance, the unconditional variance of \\(N\\) is given by \\[ \\mathrm{Var}[N]= \\alpha \\lambda_1+ (1-\\alpha) \\lambda_2 + (\\lambda_1-\\lambda_2)^2 \\alpha (1-\\alpha). \\] 2.3 Conjugate Distributions As described in Section ??, for conjugate distributions the posterior and the prior come from the same family of distributions. In insurance applications, this broadly occurs in a “family of distribution families” known as the linear exponential family which we introduce first. 2.3.1 Linear Exponential Family Definition. The distribution function of the linear exponential family is \\[ f( x; \\gamma ,\\theta ) = \\exp \\left( \\frac{x\\gamma -b(\\gamma )}{\\theta} +S\\left( x,\\theta \\right) \\right). \\] Here, \\(x\\) is a dependent variable and \\(\\gamma\\) is the parameter of interest. The quantity \\(\\theta\\) is a scale parameter. The term \\(b(\\gamma)\\) depends only on the parameter \\(\\gamma\\), not the dependent variable. The statistic \\(S\\left(x,\\theta \\right)\\) is a function of the dependent variable and the scale parameter, not the parameter \\(\\gamma\\). The dependent variable \\(x\\) may be discrete, continuous or a hybrid combination of the two. Thus, \\(f\\left( \\cdot\\right)\\) may be interpreted to be a density or mass function, depending on the application. Table 18.1 provides several examples, including the normal, binomial and Poisson distributions. Table 18.1.

The linear exponential family of distribution families is extensively used as the basis of generalized linear models as described in, for example, Frees (2009). 2.3.2 Conjugate Distributions Now assume that the parameter \\(\\gamma\\) is random with distribution \\(\\pi(\\gamma, \\tau)\\), where \\(\\tau\\) is a vector of parameters that describe the distribution of \\(\\gamma\\). In Bayesian models, the distribution \\(\\pi\\) is known as the prior and reflects our belief or information about \\(\\gamma\\). The likelihood \\(f(x|\\gamma)\\) is a probability conditional on \\(\\gamma\\). The distribution of \\(\\gamma\\) with knowledge of the random variables, \\(\\pi(\\gamma,\\tau| x)\\), is called the posterior distribution. For a given likelihood distribution, priors and posteriors that come from the same parametric family are known as conjugate families of distributions. For a linear exponential likelihood, there exists a natural conjugate family. Specifically, consider a likelihood of the form \\(f(x|\\gamma) = \\exp \\left\\{(x\\gamma -b(\\gamma))/\\theta\\right\\} \\exp \\left\\{S\\left( x,\\theta \\right) \\right\\}\\). For this likelihood, define the prior distribution \\[ \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau) = C \\exp\\left\\{ \\gamma a_1(\\tau) - b(\\gamma)a_2(\\tau))\\right\\}, \\] where \\(C\\) is a normalizing constant. Here, \\(a_1(\\tau)=a_1\\) and \\(a_2(\\tau)=a_2\\) are functions of the parameters \\(\\tau\\) although we simplify the notation by dropping explicit dependence on \\(\\tau\\). The joint distribution of \\(x\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) is given by \\(f(x,\\gamma) = f(x|\\gamma) \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau)\\). Using Bayes Theorem, the posterior distribution is \\[ \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau|x) = C_1 \\exp\\left\\{ \\gamma \\left( a_1+\\frac{x}{\\theta}\\right) - b(\\gamma)\\left( a_2+\\frac{1}{\\theta}\\right)\\right\\}, \\] where \\(C_1\\) is a normalizing constant. Thus, we see that \\(\\pi(\\gamma,\\tau|x)\\) has the same form as \\(\\pi(\\gamma,\\tau)\\). Special case. Gamma-Poisson Model. Consider a Poisson likelihood so that \\(b(\\gamma) = e^{\\gamma}\\) and scale parameter (\\(\\theta\\)) equals one. Thus, we have \\[ \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau) = C \\exp\\left\\{ \\gamma a_1 - a_2 e^{\\gamma} \\right\\}= C ~ \\left( e^{\\gamma}\\right)^{a_1} \\exp\\left(-a_2e^{\\gamma} \\right). \\] From the table of exponential family distributions, we recognize this to be a gamma distribution. That is, we have that the prior distribution of \\(\\lambda = e^{\\gamma}\\) is a gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha_{prior} = a_1+1\\) and \\(\\theta_{prior}^{-1}=a_2\\). The posterior distribution is a gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha_{post} =a_1+x+1=\\alpha_{prior}+x\\) and \\(\\theta_{post}^{-1}=a_2+1 = \\theta_{prior}^{-1}+1\\). Special case. Normal-Normal Model. Consider a normal likelihood so that \\(b(\\gamma) = \\gamma^2/2\\) and the scale parameter is \\(\\sigma^2\\). Thus, we have \\[ \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau) = C \\exp\\left\\{ \\gamma a_1 - \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2}a_2\\right\\}= C_1(\\tau)\\exp\\left\\{ - \\frac{a_2}{2}\\left(\\gamma -\\frac{a_1}{a_2}\\right)^2\\right\\}, \\] The prior distribution of \\(\\gamma\\) is normal with mean \\(a_1/a_2\\) and variance \\(a_2^{-1}\\). The posterior distribution of \\(\\gamma\\) given \\(x\\) is normal with mean \\((a_1+x/\\sigma^2)/(a_2+\\sigma^{-2})\\) and variance \\((a_2+\\sigma^{-2})^{-1}\\). Special case. Beta-Binomial Model. Consider a binomial likelihood so that \\(b(\\gamma) = n \\log(1+e^{\\gamma})\\) and scale parameter equals one. Thus, we have \\[ \\pi(\\gamma,\\tau) = C \\exp\\left\\{ \\gamma a_1 - n a_2 \\log(1+e^{\\gamma}) \\right\\}= C ~ \\left( \\frac{e^{\\gamma}}{1+e^{\\gamma}}\\right)^{a_1} \\left(1-\\frac{e^{\\gamma}}{1+e^{\\gamma}}\\right)^{-na_2+a_1}. \\] This is a beta distribution. As in the other cases, prior parameters \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) are updated to become posterior parameters \\(a_1+x\\) and \\(a_2+1\\).

Appendix Chapter 1 introduced the maximum likelihood theory regarding estimation of parameters from a parametric family. This appendix gives more specific examples and expands some of the concepts. Section 3.1 reviews the definition of the likelihood function, and introduces its properties. Section 3.2 reviews the maximum likelihood estimators, and extends their large-sample properties to the case where there are multiple parameters in the model. Section 3.3 reviews statistical inference based on maximum likelihood estimators, with specific examples on cases with multiple parameters. 3.1 Likelihood Function In this section, you learn the definitions of the likelihood function and the log-likelihood function the properties of the likelihood function From Appendix Chapter 1, the likelihood function is a function of parameters given the observed data. Here, we review the concepts of the likelihood function, and introduces its properties that are bases for maximum likelihood inference. 3.1.1 Likelihood and Log-likelihood Functions Here, we give a brief review of the likelihood function and the log-likelihood function from Appendix Chapter 1. Let \\(f(\\cdot|\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\) be the probability function of \\(X\\), the probability mass function (pmf) if \\(X\\) is discrete or the probability density function (pdf) if it is continuous. The likelihood is a function of the parameters (\\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\)) given the data (\\(\\mathbf{x}\\)). Hence, it is a function of the parameters with the data being fixed, rather than a function of the data with the parameters being fixed. The vector of data \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is usually a realization of a random sample as defined in Appendix Chapter 1. Given a realized random sample \\(\\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2,\\cdots,x_n)\\) of size \\(n\\), the likelihood function is defined as \\[ L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})=f(\\mathbf{x}|\\boldsymbol{\\theta})=\\prod_{i=1}^nf(x_i|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}), \\] with the corresponding log-likelihood function given by \\[ l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})=\\log L(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x})=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\log f(x_i|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}), \\] where \\(f(\\mathbf{x}|\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\) denotes the joint probability function of \\(\\mathbf{x}\\). The log-likelihood function leads to an additive structure that is easy to work with. In Appendix Chapter 1, we have used the normal distribution to illustrate concepts of the likelihood function and the log-likelihood function. Here, we derive the likelihood and corresponding log-likelihood functions when the population distribution is from the Pareto distribution family. Example – Pareto Distribution. Suppose that \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) represents a random sample from a single-parameter Pareto distribution with the cumulative distribution function given by \\[ F(x) = \\Pr(X_i\\leq x)=1- \\left(\\frac{500}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha}, ~~~~ x&gt;500, \\] with parameter \\(\\theta = \\alpha\\). The corresponding probability density function is \\(f(x) = 500^{\\alpha} \\alpha x^{-\\alpha-1}\\) and the log-likelihood function can be derived as \\[ l(\\boldsymbol \\alpha|\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log f(x_i;\\alpha) = n \\alpha \\log 500 +n \\log \\alpha -(\\alpha+1) \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log x_i . \\] 3.1.2 Properties of Likelihood Functions In mathematical statistics, the first derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameters, \\(u(\\boldsymbol\\theta)=\\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})/\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta\\), is referred to as the score function, or the score vector when there are multiple parameters in \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\). The score function or score vector can be written as \\[ u(\\boldsymbol\\theta)=\\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) =\\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\log \\prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i;\\boldsymbol \\theta ) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\log f(x_i;\\boldsymbol \\theta ), \\] where \\(u(\\boldsymbol\\theta)=(u_1(\\boldsymbol\\theta),u_2(\\boldsymbol\\theta),\\cdots,u_p(\\boldsymbol\\theta))\\) when \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta=(\\theta_1,\\cdots,\\theta_p)\\), with the element \\(u_k(\\boldsymbol\\theta)=\\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})/\\partial \\theta_k\\) being the partial derivative with respect to \\(\\theta_k\\) (\\(k=1,2,\\cdots,p\\)). The likelihood function has the following properties: One basic property of the likelihood function is that the expectation of the score function with respect to \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) is 0. That is, \\[ \\mathrm{E}[u(\\boldsymbol\\theta)]=\\mathrm{E} \\left[ \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) \\right] = \\mathbf 0 . \\] To illustrate this, we have \\[ \\begin{aligned} \\mathrm{E} \\left[ \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) \\right] &amp;= \\mathrm{E} \\left[ \\frac{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta}f(\\mathbf{x};\\boldsymbol \\theta)}{f(\\mathbf{x};\\boldsymbol \\theta )} \\right] = \\int\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} f(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta ) d \\mathbf y \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\int f(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta ) d \\mathbf y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} 1 = \\mathbf 0.\\end{aligned} \\] Denote by \\(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta&#39;} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})\\) the second derivative of the log-likelihood function. This is a \\(p\\times p\\) matrix of second derivatives known as the hessian of the log-likelihood. Another basic property of the likelihood function is that the sum of the expectation of the hessian matrix and the expectation of the Kronecker product of the score vector and its transpose is \\(\\mathbf 0\\). That is, \\[ \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial^2 }{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) \\right) + \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol \\theta} \\frac{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}}\\right) = \\mathbf 0. \\] Define the Fisher information matrix as \\[ \\mathcal{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\frac{ \\partial l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} \\right) = -\\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta \\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) \\right). \\] As the sample size \\(n\\) goes to infinity, the score function (vector) converges in distribution to a normal distribution (or multivariate normal distribution when \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) contains multiple parameters) with mean 0 and variance (or covariance matrix in the multivariate case) given by \\(\\mathcal{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). 3.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimators In this section, you learn the definition and derivation of the maximum likelihood estimator (mle) for parameters from a specific distribution family the properties of maximum likelihood estimators that ensure valid large-sample inference of the parameters why using the mle-based method, and what caution that needs to be taken In statistics, maximum likelihood estimators are values of the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) that are most likely to have been produced by the data. 3.2.1 Definition and Derivation of MLE Based on the definition given in Appendix Chapter 1, the value of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\), say \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}_{mle}\\), that maximizes the likelihood function, is called the maximum likelihood estimator (mle) of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\). Because the log function \\(\\log(\\cdot)\\) is a one-to-one function, we can also determine \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{mle}\\) by maximizing the log-likelihood function, \\(l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x})\\). That is, the mle is defined as \\[ \\hat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}_{mle} = {\\mbox{argmax}}_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\in\\Theta}~l(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}|\\mathbf{x}). \\] Given the analytical form of the likelihood function, the mle can be obtained by taking the first derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), and setting the values of the partial derivatives to zero. That is, the mle are the solutions of the equations of \\[ \\frac{\\partial l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}|\\mathbf{x})}{\\partial\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}}=\\mathbf 0. \\] Example. Course C/Exam 4. May 2000, 21. You are given the following five observations: 521, 658, 702, 819, 1217. You use the single-parameter Pareto with cumulative distribution function: \\[ F(x) = 1- \\left(\\frac{500}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha}, ~~~~ x&gt;500 . \\] Calculate the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameter \\(\\alpha\\). Show Example Solution Example Solution. With \\(n=5\\), the log-likelihood function is \\[ l(\\alpha|\\mathbf{x} ) = \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\log f(x_i;\\alpha ) = 5 \\alpha \\log 500 + 5 \\log \\alpha -(\\alpha+1) \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\log x_i. \\] Solving for the root of the score function yields \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\alpha } l(\\alpha |\\mathbf{x}) &amp;= 5 \\log 500 + 5 / \\alpha - \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\log x_i \\\\ &amp;=_{set} 0 \\Rightarrow \\hat{\\alpha}_{mle} = \\frac{5}{\\sum_{i=1}^5 \\log x_i - 5 \\log 500 } = 2.453 . \\end{array} \\] 3.2.2 Asymptotic Properties of MLE From Appendix Chapter 1, the MLEMaximum likelihood estimate has some nice large-sample properties, under certain regularity conditions. We presented the results for a single parameter in Appendix Chapter 1, but results are true for the case when \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) contains multiple parameters. In particular, we have the following results, in a general case when \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=(\\theta_1,\\theta_2,\\cdots,\\theta_p)\\). The mle of a parameter \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{mle}\\), is a consistent estimator. That is, the mle \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{mle}\\) converges in probability to the true value \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), as the sample size \\(n\\) goes to infinity. The mle has the asymptotic normality property, meaning that the estimator will converge in distribution to a multivariate normal distribution centered around the true value, when the sample size goes to infinity. Namely, \\[\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{mle}-\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rightarrow N\\left(\\mathbf 0,\\,\\boldsymbol{V}\\right),\\quad \\mbox{as}\\quad n\\rightarrow \\infty,\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{V}\\) denotes the asymptotic variance (or covariance matrix) of the estimator. Hence, the mle \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{mle}\\) has an approximate normal distribution with mean \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) and covariance matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{V}/n\\), when the sample size is large. The mle is efficient, meaning that it has the smallest asymptotic variance \\(\\boldsymbol{V}\\), commonly referred to as the Cramer–Rao lower bound. In particular, the Cramer–Rao lower bound is the inverse of the Fisher information (matrix) \\(\\mathcal{I}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\) defined earlier in this appendix. Hence, \\(\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{mle})\\) can be estimated based on the observed Fisher information. Based on the above results, we may perform statistical inference based on the procedures defined in Appendix Chapter 1. Example. Course C/Exam 4. Nov 2000, 13. A sample of ten observations comes from a parametric family \\(f(x,; \\theta_1, \\theta_2)\\) with log-likelihood function \\[l(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)= \\sum_{i=1}^{10} f(x_i; \\theta_1, \\theta_2) = -2.5 \\theta_1^2 - 3 \\theta_1 \\theta_2 - \\theta_2^2 + 5 \\theta_1 + 2 \\theta_2 + k,\\] where \\(k\\) is a constant. Determine the estimated covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimator, \\(\\hat{\\theta_1}, \\hat{\\theta_2}\\). Show Example Solution Example Solution. Denoting \\(l=l(\\theta_1, \\theta_2)\\), the hessian matrix of second derivatives is \\[ \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{ \\partial ^2}{\\partial \\theta_1 ^2 } l &amp; \\frac{ \\partial ^2}{\\partial \\theta_1 \\partial \\theta_2 } l \\\\ \\frac{ \\partial ^2}{\\partial \\theta_1 \\partial \\theta_2 } l &amp; \\frac{ \\partial ^2}{\\partial \\theta_1 ^2 } l \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} -5 &amp; -3 \\\\ -3 &amp; -2 \\end{array} \\right) \\] Thus, the information matrix is: \\[ \\mathcal{I}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) = -\\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta \\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} l(\\boldsymbol \\theta|\\mathbf{x}) \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 5 &amp; 3 \\\\ 3 &amp; 2 \\end{array} \\right) \\] and \\[ \\mathcal{I}^{-1}(\\theta_1, \\theta_2) = \\frac{1}{5(2) - 3(3)}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3 \\\\ -3 &amp; 5 \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -3 \\\\ -3 &amp; 5 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] 3.2.3 Use of Maximum Likelihood Estimation The method of maximum likelihood has many advantages over alternative methods such as the method of moments introduced in Appendix Chapter 1. It is a general tool that works in many situations. For example, we may be able to write out the closed-form likelihood function for censored and truncated data. Maximum likelihood estimation can be used for regression models including covariates, such as survival regression, generalized linear models and mixed models, that may include covariates that are time-dependent. From the efficiency of the mle, it is optimal, the best, in the sense that it has the smallest variance among the class of all unbiased estimators for large sample sizes. From the results on the asymptotic normality of the mle, we can obtain a large-sample distribution for the estimator, allowing users to assess the variability in the estimation and perform statistical inference on the parameters. The approach is less computationally extensive than re-sampling methods that require a large number of fittings of the model. Despite its numerous advantages, mle has its drawback in cases such as generalized linear models when it does not have a closed analytical form. In such cases, maximum likelihood estimators are computed iteratively using numerical optimization methods. For example, we may use the Newton-Raphson iterative algorithm or its variations for obtaining the mle. Iterative algorithms require starting values. For some problems, the choice of a close starting value is critical, particularly in cases where the likelihood function has local minimums or maximums. Hence, there may be a convergence issue when the starting value is far from the maximum. It is important to start from different values across the parameter space and compare the maximized likelihood or log-likelihood to make sure the algorithms have converged to a global maximum. 3.3 Statistical Inference Based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation In this section, you learn how to perform hypothesis testing based on mle for cases where there are multiple parameters in \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\) perform likelihood ratio test for cases where there are multiple parameters in \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\) In Appendix Chapter 1, we have introduced maximum likelihood based methods for statistical inference when \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\) contains a single parameter. Here, we will extend the results to cases where there are multiple parameters in \\(\\boldsymbol\\theta\\). 3.3.1 Hypothesis Testing In Appendix Chapter 1, we defined hypothesis testing concerning the null hypothesis, a statement on the parameter(s) of a distribution or model. One important type of inference is to assess whether a parameter estimate is statistically significant, meaning whether the value of the parameter is zero or not. We have learned earlier that the mle \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{mle}\\) has a large-sample normal distribution with mean \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) and the variance-covariance matrix \\(\\mathcal{I}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). Based on the multivariate normal distribution, the \\(j\\)th element of \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{mle}\\), say \\(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j}\\), has a large-sample univariate normal distribution. Define \\(se(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j})\\), the standard error (estimated standard deviation) to be the square root of the \\(j\\)th diagonal element of \\(\\mathcal{I}^{-1}(\\boldsymbol \\theta)_{mle}\\). To assess the null hypothesis that \\(\\theta_j=\\theta_0\\), we define the \\(t\\)-statistic or \\(t\\)-ratio to be \\(t(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j})=(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j}-\\theta_0)/se(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j})\\). Under the null hypothesis, it has a Student-\\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(n-p\\), with \\(p\\) being the dimension of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\). For most actuarial applications, we have a large sample size \\(n\\), so the \\(t\\)-distribution is very close to the (standard) normal distribution. In the case when \\(n\\) is very large or when the standard error is known, the \\(t\\)-statistic can be referred to as a \\(z\\)-statistic or \\(z\\)-score. Based on the results from Appendix Chapter 1, if the \\(t\\)-statistic \\(t(\\hat{\\theta}_{MLE,j})\\) exceeds a cut-off (in absolute value), then the test for the \\(j\\) parameter \\(\\theta_j\\) is said to be statistically significant. If \\(\\theta_j\\) is the regression coefficient of the \\(j\\) th independent variable, then we say that the \\(j\\)th variable is statistically significant. For example, if we use a 5% significance level, then the cut-off value is 1.96 using a normal distribution approximation for cases with a large sample size. More generally, using a \\(100 \\alpha \\%\\) significance level, then the cut-off is a \\(100(1-\\alpha/2)\\%\\) quantile from a Student-\\(t\\) distribution with the degree of freedom being \\(n-p\\). Another useful concept in hypothesis testing is the \\(p\\)-value, shorthand for probability value. From the mathematical definition in Appendix Chapter 1, a \\(p\\)-value is defined as the smallest significance level for which the null hypothesis would be rejected. Hence, the \\(p\\)-value is a useful summary statistic for the data analyst to report because it allows the reader to understand the strength of statistical evidence concerning the deviation from the null hypothesis. 3.3.2 MLE and Model Validation In addition to hypothesis testing and interval estimation introduced in Appendix Chapter 1 and the previous subsection, another important type of inference is selection of a model from two choices, where one choice is a special case of the other with certain parameters being restricted. For such two models with one being nested in the other, we have introduced the likelihood ratio test (LRT) in Appendix Chapter 1. Here, we will briefly review the process of performing a LRT based on a specific example of two alternative models. Suppose that we have a (large) model under which we derive the maximum likelihood estimator, \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{mle}\\). Now assume that some of the \\(p\\) elements in \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) are equal to zero and determine the maximum likelihood estimator over the remaining set, with the resulting estimator denoted \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{Reduced}\\). Based on the definition in Appendix Chapter 1, the statistic, \\(LRT= 2 \\left( l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{mle}) - l(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}_{Reduced}) \\right)\\), is called the likelihood ratio statistic. Under the null hypothesis that the reduced model is correct, the likelihood ratio has a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to \\(d\\), the number of variables set to zero. Such a test allows us to judge which of the two models is more likely to be correct, given the observed data. If the statistic \\(LRT\\) is large relative to the critical value from the chi-square distribution, then we reject the reduced model in favor of the larger one. Details regarding the critical value and alternative methods based on information criteria are given in Appendix Chapter 1.

Loss Data Analytics serves as a bridge between actuarial problems and methods and widely accepted statistical concepts and tools. Thus, the notation should be consistent with standard usage employed in probability and mathematical statistics. See, for example, (Halperin, Hartley, and Hoel 1965) for a description of one standard. 5.1 General Conventions Random variables are denoted by upper-case italicized Roman letters, with \\(X\\) or \\(Y\\) denoting a claim size variable, \\(N\\) a claim count variable, and \\(S\\) an aggregate loss variable. Realizations of random variables are denoted by corresponding lower-case italicized Roman letters, with \\(x\\) or \\(y\\) for claim sizes, \\(n\\) for a claim count, and \\(s\\) for an aggregate loss. Probability events are denoted by upper-case Roman letters, such as \\(\\Pr(\\mathrm{A})\\) for the probability that an outcome in the event ‘’A’’ occurs. Cumulative probability functions are denoted by \\(F(z)\\) and probability density functions by the associated lower-case Roman letter: \\(f(z)\\). For distributions, parameters are denoted by lower-case Greek letters. A caret or ‘’hat’’ indicates a sample estimate of the corresponding population parameter. For example, \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) is an estimate of \\(\\beta\\) . The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers, say, \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\), is usually denoted by \\(\\bar{x}\\); the use of \\(x\\), of course, is optional. Use upper-case boldface Roman letters to denote a matrix other than a vector. Use lower-case boldface Roman letters to denote a (column) vector. Use a superscript prime ’‘\\(\\prime\\)’’ for transpose. For example, \\(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}\\) is a quadratic form. Acronyms are to be used sparingly, given the international focus of our audience. Introduce acronyms commonly used in statistical nomenclature but limit the number of acronyms introduced. For example, pdf for probability density function is useful but GS for Gini statistic is not. 5.2 Abbreviations Here is a list of abbreviations that we adopt. We italicize these acronyms.
